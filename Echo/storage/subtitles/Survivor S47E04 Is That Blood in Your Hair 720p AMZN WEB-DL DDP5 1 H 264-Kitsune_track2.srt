1
00:00:02,724 --> 00:00:04,517
<i>-Yeah.</i>
- They asked me,
were you two dating?

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:06,103
- Us two?
-Oh, my God.

3
00:00:06,206 --> 00:00:07,482
<i>
I am engaged.</i>

4
00:00:07,586 --> 00:00:09,310
Babe, if you're watching this,

5
00:00:09,413 --> 00:00:13,068
<i>I am not in a relationship
with Sierra on</i> Survivor.

6
00:00:13,172 --> 00:00:16,103
<i>
Previously on</i> Survivor...

7
00:00:17,862 --> 00:00:19,241
<i>
Kyle wanted me out.</i>

8
00:00:19,344 --> 00:00:21,241
<i>I am gonna get revenge.</i>

9
00:00:21,344 --> 00:00:22,827
"Congratulations."

10
00:00:22,931 --> 00:00:25,448
This is exactly
what I needed, baby.

11
00:00:28,413 --> 00:00:30,103
I feel like
I'm running this game right now.

12
00:00:36,586 --> 00:00:38,206
<i>
I feel a close
personal connection with Aysha.</i>

13
00:00:41,172 --> 00:00:42,482
<i>But if Aysha won't</i>

14
00:00:42,586 --> 00:00:43,793
work with me,

15
00:00:43,896 --> 00:00:46,413
<i>is it worth
keeping her in this game?</i>

16
00:00:53,517 --> 00:00:55,137
If anybody has an advantage

17
00:00:55,241 --> 00:00:56,689
or an idol
and you want to play it...

18
00:00:56,793 --> 00:00:58,310
One second, Jeff.

19
00:00:58,413 --> 00:00:59,689
I was able to get an idol

20
00:00:59,793 --> 00:01:01,172
that's good
for one Tribal Council,

21
00:01:01,275 --> 00:01:02,655
so I'm gonna use it now.

22
00:01:02,758 --> 00:01:04,586
First vote: Sol.

23
00:01:06,827 --> 00:01:09,586
Third person voted out
of <i>Survivor</i> 47:

24
00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:10,724
Aysha.

25
00:01:13,862 --> 00:01:15,172
The tribe has spoken.

26
00:01:27,724 --> 00:01:28,655
<i>
Sol...</i>

27
00:01:28,758 --> 00:01:30,206
Yes?

28
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:32,931
You got anything to say
right off the bat?

29
00:01:33,034 --> 00:01:34,689
I'm glad I'm still here,

30
00:01:34,793 --> 00:01:36,482
but, uh, yeah,
I mean, you guys got me.

31
00:01:36,586 --> 00:01:37,931
Well played.

32
00:01:38,034 --> 00:01:39,413
<i>At Tribal Council tonight,</i>

33
00:01:39,517 --> 00:01:42,000
my ass got blindsided.

34
00:01:42,103 --> 00:01:43,551
<i>And the people who I thought
were my allies,</i>

35
00:01:43,655 --> 00:01:45,896
<i>Kish and Teeny,</i>

36
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,931
<i>they went against
what I thought was gonna happen.</i>

37
00:01:48,034 --> 00:01:49,931
<i>And Rome is still here.</i>

38
00:01:50,034 --> 00:01:51,448
<i>That's what
I'm more upset about.</i>

39
00:01:51,551 --> 00:01:54,310
We know who Rome is.
We know what kind of guy he is.

40
00:01:54,413 --> 00:01:56,137
-I know you voted for me.
- Yep.

41
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:57,482
And, uh...

42
00:01:57,586 --> 00:02:00,034
It was part of the plan--
what I thought was the plan.

43
00:02:00,137 --> 00:02:01,344
And you voted for me?

44
00:02:01,448 --> 00:02:02,724
No.

45
00:02:02,827 --> 00:02:05,172
-Who voted for me?
- We'll talk.

46
00:02:05,275 --> 00:02:07,827
<i>
I'm at the bottom of my tribe.</i>

47
00:02:07,931 --> 00:02:10,517
I have to quickly get over it,
and I have to get my mind right.

48
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:12,655
<i>Otherwise, I'm going home.</i>

49
00:02:12,758 --> 00:02:14,931
- I just want to say I'm sorry...
- Okay.

50
00:02:15,034 --> 00:02:17,172
...because I voted for you,
and I need to explain that.

51
00:02:17,275 --> 00:02:18,689
- You voted for me?
- Yes.

52
00:02:18,793 --> 00:02:20,137
Okay.

53
00:02:20,241 --> 00:02:22,413
And I know that goes against
every promise I made to you,

54
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:24,034
and I understand
if you're pissed.

55
00:02:24,137 --> 00:02:26,206
<i>I'd love to claim
the vote for Sol</i>

56
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:28,034
<i>as purely this mastermind</i>

57
00:02:28,137 --> 00:02:32,137
strategic plan,
but that's not entirely true.

58
00:02:32,241 --> 00:02:34,551
<i>I could not fathom
writing Aysha's name down</i>

59
00:02:34,655 --> 00:02:37,034
<i>because of
my emotional bond with her.</i>

60
00:02:37,137 --> 00:02:38,379
<i>You know, this isn't a moment</i>

61
00:02:38,482 --> 00:02:40,482
where I'm like, "Yes,
we just nailed a blindside."

62
00:02:40,586 --> 00:02:42,965
It's a moment where I am upset.

63
00:02:43,068 --> 00:02:44,413
I-I think that's gonna haunt me.

64
00:02:44,517 --> 00:02:46,413
I think that's gonna be, like...

65
00:02:49,206 --> 00:02:50,448
This is a game.

66
00:02:50,551 --> 00:02:52,931
And if the people playing
the game can't handle that,

67
00:02:53,034 --> 00:02:54,724
that's on them. It's not on you.

68
00:02:54,827 --> 00:02:55,965
- Okay?
- I know, but, like,

69
00:02:56,068 --> 00:02:58,241
am I the person
who can't handle it is really...

70
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:00,137
You're gonna be able to...

71
00:03:01,137 --> 00:03:02,931
I wanted to come out here
and be this villainous

72
00:03:03,034 --> 00:03:05,586
mastermind player
who was able to make decisions

73
00:03:05,689 --> 00:03:08,206
based purely off
how I could advance in the game.

74
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:10,068
<i>But at the same time,
I know myself.</i>

75
00:03:10,172 --> 00:03:11,724
<i>I'm sensitive.</i>

76
00:03:11,827 --> 00:03:13,965
And that's something that
I just have to learn to balance

77
00:03:14,068 --> 00:03:15,827
as I move forward in this game.

78
00:03:17,379 --> 00:03:18,793
No.

79
00:03:18,896 --> 00:03:20,896
That's why I was very-- I was,
like, I thought it was you.

80
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,241
I feel like
we all played that perfectly.

81
00:03:23,344 --> 00:03:26,793
And now we have
the majority alliance.

82
00:03:26,896 --> 00:03:28,413
We got a solidified alliance.

83
00:03:28,517 --> 00:03:30,517
Like, we're,
we're ready to roll.

84
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:35,620
Tonight, Tribal Council went
exactly how I wanted it to go.

85
00:03:35,724 --> 00:03:37,448
<i>Aysha went home.</i>

86
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:40,827
<i>- Sol messed up,
and he knows he's on the bottom.

87
00:03:40,931 --> 00:03:42,758
And Rome ended up prevailing, baby.

88
00:03:42,862 --> 00:03:44,793
We all made it
through our first Tribal.

89
00:03:44,896 --> 00:03:45,896
-Yeah.
-Mm-hmm.

90
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,758
- That's huge.
-Mm-hmm.

91
00:03:49,931 --> 00:03:50,827
Yeah.

92
00:03:50,931 --> 00:03:52,310
Which, like...

93
00:03:54,586 --> 00:03:56,620
Oh, my God.

94
00:04:00,758 --> 00:04:01,655
Yeah.

95
00:04:01,758 --> 00:04:03,103
This <i>Survivor</i> game is going

96
00:04:03,206 --> 00:04:04,413
perfectly for me
up to this point.

97
00:04:04,517 --> 00:04:07,724
<i>I feel like
I'm in control all the way.</i>

98
00:04:07,827 --> 00:04:09,862
<i>So if we got to go
back to Tribal Council again,</i>

99
00:04:09,965 --> 00:04:14,344

- That was a bad one...
- No, that was so good!

116
00:05:54,137 --> 00:05:56,137
<i>
Freestyling,
going with the flow</i>

117
00:05:56,241 --> 00:05:58,000
<i>is kind of
how I'm playing</i> Survivor.

118
00:05:58,103 --> 00:05:59,000
<i>And right now</i>

119
00:05:59,103 --> 00:06:00,689
Sierra is my number one.

120
00:06:00,793 --> 00:06:02,482
<i>The two of us
are sitting in the middle.</i>

121
00:06:02,586 --> 00:06:05,000
<i>So if we go to Tribal Council,</i>

122
00:06:05,103 --> 00:06:07,827
<i>we can stick
with Anika and Rachel</i>

123
00:06:07,931 --> 00:06:10,965
<i>or pick up Andy,
and we still have the majority.</i>

124
00:06:11,068 --> 00:06:12,482
So we're in the know
and in the middle

125
00:06:12,586 --> 00:06:13,758
and in the driver's seat.

126
00:06:14,793 --> 00:06:16,379
- You feeling okay?
- I'm feeling good.

127
00:06:16,482 --> 00:06:17,862
All right, good.

128
00:06:17,965 --> 00:06:19,000
Yeah.

129
00:06:21,379 --> 00:06:22,310
No.

130
00:06:22,413 --> 00:06:23,413
I don't think it's a big factor.

131
00:06:23,517 --> 00:06:24,620
- I don't think...
- And I don't think,

132
00:06:24,724 --> 00:06:25,827
I don't think
it was something Ani needed

133
00:06:25,931 --> 00:06:27,758
to come back and, like, plot

134
00:06:27,862 --> 00:06:29,103
<i>into our heads, too, but...</i>

135
00:06:29,206 --> 00:06:30,724
<i>we need to make sure
we clear that air.</i>

136
00:06:30,827 --> 00:06:31,793
For sure.

137
00:06:31,896 --> 00:06:34,275
Because that will change
my whole game.

138
00:06:34,379 --> 00:06:35,931
<i>When Anika
came back from the journey,</i>

139
00:06:36,034 --> 00:06:37,793
<i>she said
the other tribes are picking up</i>

140
00:06:37,896 --> 00:06:39,517
that Sam and I
are working together.

141
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:42,448
We're not dating,
but we are working together.

142
00:06:42,551 --> 00:06:44,275
And what
is giving them that vibe?

143
00:06:44,379 --> 00:06:45,655
<i>I'm not sure.</i>

144
00:06:45,758 --> 00:06:47,965
You've spent so much alone time
with Ani and Rachel,

145
00:06:48,068 --> 00:06:50,482
- it's, like, equal. Like,
why is it that we're dating?
- I know, I know.

146
00:06:50,586 --> 00:06:53,137
- Why couldn't you be
dating Ani or Rachel?
- Ani says it's aesthetic.

147
00:06:53,241 --> 00:06:55,344
- She said,
it's Ken and Barbie, and...
- Ken and Barbie?

148
00:06:55,448 --> 00:06:56,862
Get out of here.

149
00:06:56,965 --> 00:06:58,379
<i>Whatever. I'm not even
gonna let it get in my head.</i>

150
00:06:58,482 --> 00:06:59,517
<i>But I think,</i>

151
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:01,413
moving forward in the game,
I don't

152
00:07:01,517 --> 00:07:04,172
<i>want them to know that Sam and I
are this tight alliance.</i>

153
00:07:04,275 --> 00:07:06,689
<i>So I'm gonna make sure
Anika and Rachel know</i>

154
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:08,448
<i>that I want to work with them</i>

155
00:07:08,551 --> 00:07:10,793
and make sure
that line is, like, clear.

156
00:07:15,862 --> 00:07:16,827
Oh, are we alone?

157
00:07:16,931 --> 00:07:17,931
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

158
00:07:18,034 --> 00:07:19,517
What do you--
How do you like, uh...

159
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:21,965
What did I say?
The... the Breadwinners.

160
00:07:22,068 --> 00:07:23,103
Oh, oh, oh, the Breadwinners.

161
00:07:23,206 --> 00:07:25,172
The Breadwinners? Yes. Yes.

162
00:07:25,275 --> 00:07:27,172
- We are. We're the Breadwinners.
- Right?

163
00:07:27,275 --> 00:07:29,206
- And we're gonna win that bread.

164
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:32,448
<i>When it comes
to camp life and challenges,</i>

165
00:07:32,551 --> 00:07:34,862
the three girls here
have truly been

166
00:07:34,965 --> 00:07:37,482
the powerhouses of this tribe.

167
00:07:37,586 --> 00:07:41,448
<i>And so we call ourselves
the Breadwinner alliance.</i>

168
00:07:41,551 --> 00:07:43,344
We have a very, like...

169
00:07:44,758 --> 00:07:46,034
...relationship.

170
00:07:46,137 --> 00:07:47,655
I just want to make sure,
at least going

171
00:07:47,758 --> 00:07:48,896
into everything, it's us three.

172
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,448
- 100%.
- Oh, my God. Dude. Sierra.

173
00:07:50,551 --> 00:07:52,344
- Let them see.
- Look me in the eye.
Look me in the eye.

174
00:07:52,448 --> 00:07:53,931
- Absolutely.
-Yes.
- Okay.

175
00:07:54,034 --> 00:07:56,482
<i>
Having a strong alliance
of women is incredible.</i>

176
00:07:56,586 --> 00:07:59,172
<i>Anika has been
my number one since day one.</i>

177
00:07:59,275 --> 00:08:01,758
And then also having Sierra,
who I also really trust

178
00:08:01,862 --> 00:08:03,379
<i>at this point,
is amazing for me.</i>

179
00:08:03,482 --> 00:08:04,862
Breadwinners.

180
00:08:04,965 --> 00:08:06,034
- Breadwinners?

181
00:08:06,137 --> 00:08:07,413
<i>I feel good.</i>

182
00:08:07,517 --> 00:08:09,827
I feel like my game's
going as well as I could hope

183
00:08:09,931 --> 00:08:11,137
it could be going right now.

184
00:08:23,413 --> 00:08:24,896
Sue?

185
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
-You okay?
What happened?

186
00:08:27,103 --> 00:08:28,517
Just feeling emotional.

187
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:31,000
I just, um...

188
00:08:31,103 --> 00:08:33,931
I'm feeling like
I'm tired, you know?

189
00:08:34,034 --> 00:08:35,931
Like, when I get tired,
I just get emotional.

190
00:08:38,103 --> 00:08:40,620
I don't want to be crying on TV.

191
00:08:40,724 --> 00:08:42,827
Join the club. I already did.

192
00:08:42,931 --> 00:08:44,344
Had myself a little cry

193
00:08:44,448 --> 00:08:45,689
- earlier this morning.
-You did?

194
00:08:45,793 --> 00:08:47,758
Yep. Once you accept
that it's part of the process,

195
00:08:47,862 --> 00:08:50,034
it's a little bit easier
to let out.

196
00:08:50,137 --> 00:08:52,482
<i>Before I even
came into this game,</i>

197
00:08:52,586 --> 00:08:55,379
my number one target for an ally
was gonna be

198
00:08:55,482 --> 00:08:57,172
<i>an older woman,
preferably a mother.</i>

199
00:08:57,275 --> 00:08:59,000
<i>I wanted to play with a Sue,</i>

200
00:08:59,103 --> 00:09:03,172
and the island fortune
brought me a Sue.

201
00:09:03,275 --> 00:09:04,586
- Feeling a little better?
- Yeah.

202
00:09:04,689 --> 00:09:06,103
- Give me a hug.
- Thank you.

203
00:09:06,206 --> 00:09:08,758
- You know I got you, right?
- I know you do. Thank you.

204
00:09:08,862 --> 00:09:10,379
<i>
I think she's somebody
who really wears her heart</i>

205
00:09:10,482 --> 00:09:13,655
<i>on her sleeve, but
she also tells me everything.</i>

206
00:09:13,758 --> 00:09:15,758
- I'll protect you.
- Yeah, and I'll protect you.

207
00:09:15,862 --> 00:09:17,068
- 100%.
- Yeah.

208
00:09:17,172 --> 00:09:18,344
<i>
Sue has given me</i>

209
00:09:18,448 --> 00:09:21,241
every piece of knowledge
that she has in this game,

210
00:09:21,344 --> 00:09:25,310
<i>so I'm very confident in
my alliance with Sue right now.</i>

211
00:09:25,413 --> 00:09:27,448
-You should be
proud of yourself.
-Thank you.

212
00:09:30,482 --> 00:09:32,241
Yeah, I know.

213
00:09:32,344 --> 00:09:34,413
I know. I cannot wait.

214
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:39,551
- Yeah.
- Yeah, true.

215
00:09:39,655 --> 00:09:43,310
<i>
Right now, people see me
as a mom. I'm a grandma.</i>

216
00:09:43,413 --> 00:09:46,103
<i>100%, they're underestimating me</i>

217
00:09:46,206 --> 00:09:48,482
because I am
the older generation,

218
00:09:48,586 --> 00:09:51,724
<i>but I'm hiding
a lot from my tribe.</i>

219
00:09:51,827 --> 00:09:55,137
<i>They have no clue
that I'm 58 years old.</i>

220
00:09:57,172 --> 00:09:58,103
-Damn. Really?
- Yeah.

221
00:09:58,206 --> 00:09:59,310
Like, that's awesome.

222
00:09:59,413 --> 00:10:02,068
That, like...
If the good Lord's willing,

223
00:10:02,172 --> 00:10:03,689
that leaves a lot of time.

224
00:10:03,793 --> 00:10:06,620
I don't need to be wheelchaired
around or need a cane or need...

225
00:10:06,724 --> 00:10:10,034
- No.
- You know,
I can just do it all, so...

226
00:10:10,137 --> 00:10:13,551
<i>They have no idea
that I am a badass pilot,</i>

227
00:10:13,655 --> 00:10:15,689
<i>and I'm an adrenaline junkie</i>

228
00:10:15,793 --> 00:10:17,724
<i>always looking for a rush.</i>

229
00:10:17,827 --> 00:10:19,655
I'm here for the journey.
I'm here for

230
00:10:19,758 --> 00:10:21,482
<i>the thrill of it.</i>

231
00:10:21,586 --> 00:10:24,344
<i>And this is exciting because
nobody would ever suspect</i>

232
00:10:24,448 --> 00:10:28,068
<i>that I've been spending my time
secretly looking for an idol.</i>

233
00:10:28,172 --> 00:10:30,862
I want that power.
I want that protection.

234
00:10:30,965 --> 00:10:34,379
<i>I want the thrill
of finding an idol.</i>

235
00:10:38,965 --> 00:10:40,413
Ah. Oh.

236
00:10:40,517 --> 00:10:42,448
<i>No way.</i>

237
00:10:42,551 --> 00:10:46,034
<i>It is
a freaking Beware Advantage.</i>

238
00:10:46,137 --> 00:10:47,862
I couldn't open
that packet fast enough.

239
00:11:04,551 --> 00:11:07,896
<i>The map was giving me
very specific instructions.</i>

240
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,275
Now I got to get this.

241
00:11:09,379 --> 00:11:12,862
<i>But if I don't find
that palm tree and get my idol,</i>

242
00:11:12,965 --> 00:11:14,103
<i>I don't vote.</i>

243
00:11:14,206 --> 00:11:16,103
So it's behind the water well.

244
00:11:16,206 --> 00:11:18,310
Going that direction.

245
00:11:19,965 --> 00:11:22,172
<i>The rope was hidden in vines.</i>

246
00:11:22,275 --> 00:11:24,586
<i>But now that I knew
what I was looking for,</i>

247
00:11:24,689 --> 00:11:27,448
<i>that rope stood out
like a sore thumb.</i>

248
00:11:41,586 --> 00:11:42,827
<i>A bucket fractures,</i>

249
00:11:42,931 --> 00:11:44,931
and paint just bursts
all over the place.

250
00:11:45,034 --> 00:11:47,620
<i>And I see the idol there.</i>

251
00:11:49,482 --> 00:11:51,862
<i>I have no idea
what I'm gonna do.</i>

252
00:11:51,965 --> 00:11:54,448
<i>Obviously, I don't want
to get caught red-handed.</i>

253
00:11:54,551 --> 00:11:56,689
This is crazy.

254
00:11:56,793 --> 00:11:59,896
<i>It is horrifying
to see all of this paint.</i>

255
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,137
<i>It looks like
blood splattered everywhere.</i>

256
00:12:03,241 --> 00:12:04,793
And I need to cover my tracks

257
00:12:04,896 --> 00:12:08,517
because I don't want anybody
knowing that I have an idol.

258
00:12:21,448 --> 00:12:23,586
<i>It is literally
like a crime scene,</i>

259
00:12:23,689 --> 00:12:24,862
<i>that I was the murderer,</i>

260
00:12:24,965 --> 00:12:26,206
<i>and now I'm trying</i>

261
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:27,448
to cover my tracks.

262
00:12:27,551 --> 00:12:31,310
<i>I'm so desperate
to get rid of all the evidence,</i>

263
00:12:31,413 --> 00:12:33,310
<i>knowing that the police
are coming any second.</i>

264
00:12:33,413 --> 00:12:34,379
I've got to cover up everything

265
00:12:34,482 --> 00:12:35,689
<i>so that nobody knows it's me.</i>

266
00:12:35,793 --> 00:12:39,206
<i>I have paint on my legs.
It's on the water well.</i>

267
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:42,620
<i>And then, on top of that,
the trees had paint on them.</i>

268
00:12:42,724 --> 00:12:44,931
<i>It's just out of control.</i>

269
00:12:45,034 --> 00:12:46,965
I'm gonna kill Jeff
for making this so hard.

270
00:12:47,068 --> 00:12:48,793
<i>It's taking me forever,</i>

271
00:12:48,896 --> 00:12:50,827
but I slowly see progress.

272
00:12:50,931 --> 00:12:53,655
<i>And finally,
I got rid of all the evidence.</i>

273
00:12:53,758 --> 00:12:56,482
<i>Not one person will ever,
ever know I have</i>

274
00:12:56,586 --> 00:12:58,275
<i>a hidden immunity idol.</i>

275
00:12:58,379 --> 00:12:59,620
I pulled it off.

276
00:13:00,689 --> 00:13:02,448
<i>I pulled it off.</i>

277
00:13:04,827 --> 00:13:06,137
Hey. How was your walk?

278
00:13:07,206 --> 00:13:08,379
Yeah, I'm just chilling.

279
00:13:08,482 --> 00:13:09,758
No, I'm good. I'm good.

280
00:13:09,862 --> 00:13:11,172
I just wanted to chill
for a little while and just...

281
00:13:11,275 --> 00:13:12,344
-Of course.
- I don't know.

282
00:13:12,448 --> 00:13:14,034
Is your chin okay?

283
00:13:14,137 --> 00:13:15,137
Yeah.

284
00:13:16,965 --> 00:13:18,137
Did you fall?

285
00:13:18,241 --> 00:13:19,724
- I was playing with the machete.
I'm good.

286
00:13:19,827 --> 00:13:21,586
I just, it's okay.

287
00:13:21,689 --> 00:13:23,275
Is that blood in your hair?

288
00:13:25,896 --> 00:13:27,517
I'm okay. I didn't cut myself.

289
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:28,793
I-I just did something stupid.

290
00:13:28,896 --> 00:13:30,241
I'm fine.

291
00:13:33,137 --> 00:13:36,827
<i>
Caroline and I
found Sue with the machete.</i>

292
00:13:36,931 --> 00:13:40,344
<i>There is blood all over
her hands and all over her face.</i>

293
00:13:40,448 --> 00:13:42,344
Immediately,
my red flag was raised

294
00:13:42,448 --> 00:13:44,551
because I was
kind of confused as to what

295
00:13:44,655 --> 00:13:45,758
<i>she could have possibly done.</i>

296
00:13:45,862 --> 00:13:47,103
I'm fine, but I just...

297
00:13:47,206 --> 00:13:49,034
I have to clean up.
I'm a little mess.

298
00:13:49,137 --> 00:13:50,862
-That's okay.
- But I'll talk
to you guys later.

299
00:13:50,965 --> 00:13:52,206
Take your time. We'll probably

300
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:53,413
- be down at the beach,
uh, crabbing.
- Okay.

301
00:13:53,517 --> 00:13:55,206
- Okay. Thank you.
-Yeah.

302
00:13:56,206 --> 00:13:57,310
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

303
00:14:01,896 --> 00:14:03,413
I got to keep an eye

304
00:14:03,517 --> 00:14:04,724
<i>on Sue.</i>

305
00:14:04,827 --> 00:14:05,724
<i>I'm suspicious.</i>

306
00:14:05,827 --> 00:14:07,862
<i>I can smell BS from afar.</i>

307
00:14:07,965 --> 00:14:10,137
Shoot, shoot, shoot.

308
00:14:25,172 --> 00:14:27,931
<i>
Last night, I played my idol
that was good for one Tribal.</i>

309
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:31,034
<i>Usually,
that idol gets replaced.</i>

310
00:14:31,137 --> 00:14:33,137
-This is tough.
- Yeah.

311
00:14:33,241 --> 00:14:35,275
<i>You know, I know that
I'm probably the best one</i>

312
00:14:35,379 --> 00:14:36,551
at looking for idols
on my tribe,

313
00:14:36,655 --> 00:14:37,931
which is a comforting thing,

314
00:14:38,034 --> 00:14:40,862
<i>but everyone right now
is looking for idols.</i>

315
00:14:40,965 --> 00:14:42,000
No.

316
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,689
<i>
Sol is looking hard
for this idol,</i>

317
00:14:47,793 --> 00:14:49,034
<i>and that is very scary.</i>

318
00:14:49,137 --> 00:14:50,275
<i>We want to make sure that,</i>

319
00:14:50,379 --> 00:14:52,241
no matter what, Sol cannot find

320
00:14:52,344 --> 00:14:54,655
<i>this idol.
Anyone but Sol. Anyone but Sol.</i>

321
00:15:01,379 --> 00:15:03,000
If you're gonna
keep looking for one, that's...

322
00:15:03,103 --> 00:15:04,482
Yeah, that's more
of a threat than someone

323
00:15:04,586 --> 00:15:06,655
just sitting back at camp
trying to be kumbaya.

324
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:09,758
Really, dude?

325
00:15:09,862 --> 00:15:11,172
<i>I know what he's doing.</i>

326
00:15:11,275 --> 00:15:13,724
He wants to vote me out,
and he's trying to prevent me

327
00:15:13,827 --> 00:15:16,862
from searching for idols
so I don't get one.

328
00:15:16,965 --> 00:15:18,206
<i>And he's threatening me
to do that.</i>

329
00:15:19,896 --> 00:15:21,241
I'm just saying,
there's a time to do it

330
00:15:21,344 --> 00:15:22,275
and there's a time not to.

331
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:24,000
And, like,
the people at the top,

332
00:15:24,103 --> 00:15:25,896
they kind of have
that freedom to do it.

333
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,896
But, like, I don't know
why you would just increase

334
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,448
the target on your back.

335
00:15:29,551 --> 00:15:30,655
<i>
He's, like,
ten years younger than me,</i>

336
00:15:30,758 --> 00:15:33,620
<i>and he's talking to me
like I'm a kid.</i>

337
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:35,379
What the hell? What?

338
00:15:35,482 --> 00:15:36,758
What's happening right now?

339
00:15:36,862 --> 00:15:38,758
And again, I got to go Zen.

340
00:15:40,379 --> 00:15:41,896
<i>"Sol, relax."</i>

341
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,620
<i>
I don't want him
looking for an idol at all.</i>

342
00:15:43,724 --> 00:15:45,517
That's gonna be a problem.

343
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:47,793
We're fine
if he doesn't find it.

344
00:15:47,896 --> 00:15:50,137
-Yeah.
- Which, at this moment,
he hasn't.

345
00:15:50,241 --> 00:15:53,931
<i>Sol and Rome
are on opposite planets,</i>

346
00:15:54,034 --> 00:15:56,103
<i>and that is a positive for me.</i>

347
00:15:56,206 --> 00:15:58,275
I'm not here to play safe.
I'm here to create some chaos,

348
00:15:58,379 --> 00:16:02,206
<i>which is why I've been pushing
for them to continue clashing,</i>

349
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:04,620
<i>so they will not work
with each other.</i>

350
00:16:08,931 --> 00:16:11,758
<i>I think my strength
is getting to know people,</i>

351
00:16:11,862 --> 00:16:13,137
really understanding them,

352
00:16:13,241 --> 00:16:15,689
and then being able
to beautifully manipulate them.

353
00:16:15,793 --> 00:16:17,896
I've never been
a babysitter before.

354
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,206
Really?

355
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:21,206
-No.
- That was my first job.

356
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:23,275
Hey, we're going
looking for an idol, guys,

357
00:16:23,379 --> 00:16:24,482
if you guys want to come.

358
00:16:27,413 --> 00:16:29,103
I'm just going
to refill my water.

359
00:16:33,827 --> 00:16:36,620
I am now going
to go get coconut after this.

360
00:16:45,655 --> 00:16:47,896
<i>With Rome, it's either his way</i>

361
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,172
<i>or "I'm gonna pout
like a five-year-old" way.</i>

362
00:16:50,275 --> 00:16:52,379
<i>He's gonna throw
the biggest tantrum.</i>

363
00:16:52,482 --> 00:16:53,724
I ain't trying to deal
with that all day long.

364
00:16:53,827 --> 00:16:55,275
'Cause it's exhausting
and it's messing

365
00:16:55,379 --> 00:16:56,482
<i>my game up.</i>

366
00:16:56,586 --> 00:16:58,620
Could I have
a minute alone, please?

367
00:16:58,724 --> 00:17:00,689
- No. It's <i>Survivor.</i>
I don't have to.
- Seriously?

368
00:17:00,793 --> 00:17:02,000
I'm-a follow you around.

369
00:17:02,103 --> 00:17:03,827
Now, can I, can I sit over there
by the beach alone?

370
00:17:03,931 --> 00:17:05,862
- Like...
- I'm-a sit right next to you.
That's fine.

371
00:17:05,965 --> 00:17:07,620
All right. Whatever.

372
00:17:07,724 --> 00:17:10,206
<i>
It is about as awkward
as awkward can be.</i>

373
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:13,965
<i>I know that Rome is just trying
to protect our four,</i>

374
00:17:14,068 --> 00:17:16,655
<i>but, like,
he just plays the game</i>

375
00:17:16,758 --> 00:17:19,827
at an intensity level
that is not a match

376
00:17:19,931 --> 00:17:21,103
<i>with my own.</i>

377
00:17:22,275 --> 00:17:23,827
He's not looking
for anything right now.

378
00:17:23,931 --> 00:17:26,862
<i>And he's devoid
of any sort of concept</i>

379
00:17:26,965 --> 00:17:29,206
<i>of what Sol might be feeling</i>

380
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:30,586
<i>as one, a player,</i>

381
00:17:30,689 --> 00:17:32,172
and two, you know, a grown man,

382
00:17:32,275 --> 00:17:33,931
a human being on this Earth.

383
00:17:34,034 --> 00:17:36,655
It's just a lot. So much.

384
00:17:36,758 --> 00:17:37,965
Oh, I'm sorry, Sol.

385
00:17:38,068 --> 00:17:39,172
It's all good.

386
00:17:39,275 --> 00:17:43,379
That's really not how I,
personally, want to play.

387
00:17:43,482 --> 00:17:45,310
- You're not out.
- All right.

388
00:17:45,413 --> 00:17:47,310
- They can knock you down,
but they can't get you out.
- Right.

389
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:50,172
Yeah.

390
00:17:50,275 --> 00:17:52,586
<i>Of course I feel bad for Sol.</i>

391
00:17:52,689 --> 00:17:55,310
<i>Rome is being rude,
and, you know,</i>

392
00:17:55,413 --> 00:17:58,068
<i>Rome and I have a really good
relationship and are very close,</i>

393
00:17:58,172 --> 00:18:00,827
<i>but it's also
a complicated relationship</i>

394
00:18:00,931 --> 00:18:02,724
for me to navigate because

395
00:18:02,827 --> 00:18:05,275
he's such a big personality
and does rub people

396
00:18:05,379 --> 00:18:06,448
<i>the wrong way.</i>

397
00:18:06,551 --> 00:18:08,206
I think each
of our mistakes was getting

398
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:10,689
a little too locked in with what
we thought dynamics were

399
00:18:10,793 --> 00:18:12,551
- and not being
fluid enough, you know?
- Yes.

400
00:18:12,655 --> 00:18:14,448
Absolutely.

401
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:16,241
Please don't tell Rome
I'm saying this.

402
00:18:16,344 --> 00:18:18,241
You and I, if you allow it,

403
00:18:18,344 --> 00:18:20,206
- we are allies moving forward.
- I know. Yeah, yeah.

404
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:22,931
- No, no, no, no, no.
I'm dead serious. Yeah.
- I'm cool. I'm down. I'm down.

405
00:18:23,034 --> 00:18:25,344
I'm actually getting
really excited right now.

406
00:18:25,448 --> 00:18:27,379
<i>
Sol is on the outs
and is a free agent.</i>

407
00:18:27,482 --> 00:18:30,758
<i>And I want to really
nurture that relationship,</i>

408
00:18:30,862 --> 00:18:32,827
<i>because Rome has ruffled all
these feathers that it's like,</i>

409
00:18:32,931 --> 00:18:35,344
<i>I can only
make the case for Rome</i>

410
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:39,344
so many times before it ends up
being a case against me.

411
00:18:46,724 --> 00:18:48,241
What?

412
00:18:48,344 --> 00:18:49,586
Uh-oh.

413
00:18:49,689 --> 00:18:50,896
Uh-oh.

414
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:51,965
Might be Andy's.

415
00:18:52,068 --> 00:18:53,379
I feel like
his bag's always open.

416
00:18:53,482 --> 00:18:56,241
Yeah, it's definitely
Andy's Shot in the Dark.

417
00:18:56,344 --> 00:18:57,275
Oh, my God.

418
00:18:57,379 --> 00:18:59,758
Andy, why are you so sloppy?

419
00:18:59,862 --> 00:19:01,586
-Yeah, just put it
back where it was.
-Just drop it.

420
00:19:01,689 --> 00:19:03,172
- Just drop it
where it was. Yeah.
-Just drop it. Yeah.

421
00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:05,172
<i>Sure enough, Andy--</i>

422
00:19:05,275 --> 00:19:07,137
the one guy who might
need his Shot in the Dark--

423
00:19:07,241 --> 00:19:10,206
somehow allowed it
to just fumble out of his bag.

424
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:12,448
Your Shot in the Dark
fell out of your bag.

425
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:15,034
It's sitting on the sand,
under the shelter right now.

426
00:19:15,137 --> 00:19:18,344
You're gonna have
to go into camp and get it.

427
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:20,931
- Yeah.
- But also, like, make a scene.

428
00:19:21,034 --> 00:19:22,448
<i>Right now I'm a little bit</i>

429
00:19:22,551 --> 00:19:24,344
of a mentor to Andy's game.

430
00:19:24,448 --> 00:19:28,137
<i>I'm just showing him
how to play subtle</i> Survivor.

431
00:19:28,241 --> 00:19:29,862
Do you mind if I nap?

432
00:19:29,965 --> 00:19:31,482
No, go for it.

433
00:19:31,586 --> 00:19:33,620
<i>
He just needs
a little guidance is all.</i>

434
00:19:33,724 --> 00:19:35,000
<i>I think
we're still working on it.</i>

435
00:19:35,103 --> 00:19:36,758
Big work in progress, but...

436
00:19:36,862 --> 00:19:38,793
he's a bit of
a clumsy player at times.

437
00:19:42,965 --> 00:19:44,620
All right, all right, all right.

438
00:19:44,724 --> 00:19:47,000
Andy's kind of
like <i>Survivor</i> George Costanza.

439
00:19:47,103 --> 00:19:48,793
He can't get out of his own way.

440
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:50,172
I just tore my underwear.

441
00:19:51,586 --> 00:19:52,896
On, like, a... Oh, my God.

442
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,137
Yeah.
It's, like, gaping right now.

443
00:19:54,241 --> 00:19:55,827
<i>
Everything Andy does...</i>

444
00:19:55,931 --> 00:19:57,034
Whoo!

445
00:19:57,137 --> 00:19:58,551
<i>...he should do
the exact opposite</i>

446
00:19:58,655 --> 00:20:01,482
<i>of whatever he thinks
is the right thing to do.</i>

447
00:20:02,931 --> 00:20:04,068
<i>I'm just trying to make sure</i>

448
00:20:04,172 --> 00:20:05,896
<i>that I'm always
one step ahead of him</i>

449
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
and that he's always coming
back to me with the information.

450
00:20:08,103 --> 00:20:09,551
As long as
he's doing that, like,

451
00:20:09,655 --> 00:20:11,241
Andy can stay around,
in my book.

452
00:20:11,344 --> 00:20:13,275
- Two minutes ago...
- Yeah?

453
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:15,137
...I looked in my bag, and...

454
00:20:15,241 --> 00:20:17,655
...the Shot in the Dark
was gone again,

455
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:20,620
and I looked everywhere, and it
was just on the ground at camp.

456
00:20:20,724 --> 00:20:22,241
- Dude.
- I'm like, "What?"

457
00:20:22,344 --> 00:20:24,827
- So I put it in my sock
from here on out.
- Okay.

458
00:20:24,931 --> 00:20:27,034
- I'm like,
"Don't make me have to..."
- Don't worry. Don't worry.

459
00:20:27,137 --> 00:20:28,413
Andy is such a sloppy player.

460
00:20:28,517 --> 00:20:30,689
I'm like, "Do I really
want to move forward with that?"

461
00:20:30,793 --> 00:20:33,275
<i>I know that Sam
wants to work with him,</i>

462
00:20:33,379 --> 00:20:35,103
<i>but I'm still up in the air,</i>

463
00:20:35,206 --> 00:20:37,000
and it's driving me
freaking nuts.

464
00:20:37,103 --> 00:20:39,310
I just feel like Ani and Rachel
are definitely, like, tight.

465
00:20:39,413 --> 00:20:41,172
- You know,
I feel like we're a three.
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.

466
00:20:41,275 --> 00:20:43,689
- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
- But I feel like they're a two,
and...

467
00:20:47,448 --> 00:20:48,896
- Yeah, they get pretty specific.
- Yeah.

468
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,206
Like, you know,
they call-- they have a name.

469
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:52,793
Like, we're
now the Breadwinners.

470
00:20:52,896 --> 00:20:54,482
- The Breadwinners.
- Don't say that.

471
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,551
Um, but, you know,

472
00:20:57,655 --> 00:20:59,586
so, yeah, there is, like,
a deep connection.

473
00:20:59,689 --> 00:21:01,103
<i>
I made a point</i>

474
00:21:01,206 --> 00:21:03,482
and made a mission to build
a real good bond with Sierra,

475
00:21:03,586 --> 00:21:04,931
and it's coming on strong.

476
00:21:05,034 --> 00:21:06,379
Whenever I talk to you,
I just...

477
00:21:06,482 --> 00:21:07,551
You feel better?

478
00:21:07,655 --> 00:21:09,551
I could cry.
Like, I just love you.

479
00:21:09,655 --> 00:21:11,275
Oh, good.
I know. I love you guys.

480
00:21:11,379 --> 00:21:13,379
I love everybody, you know?

481
00:21:13,482 --> 00:21:15,620
Because she gave me
that Breadwinners name,

482
00:21:15,724 --> 00:21:17,103
I know she's with me,

483
00:21:17,206 --> 00:21:19,517
because I know she's throwing
that alliance under the bus.

484
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:20,793
She's throwing it away.

485
00:21:20,896 --> 00:21:23,517
<i>And I believe,
truly, that she's down</i>

486
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:25,344
<i>to work with myself and Sam.</i>

487
00:21:25,448 --> 00:21:27,586
I feel like I can tell you
everything Sierra tells me.

488
00:21:27,689 --> 00:21:29,413
- Yeah.
- So, and it's very good.

489
00:21:29,517 --> 00:21:30,827
I had
the most amazing conversation

490
00:21:30,931 --> 00:21:32,000
with her this morning.

491
00:21:32,103 --> 00:21:34,206
<i>She said not to say it
to anyone.</i>

492
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:35,931
<i>I asked her how specific
that these other</i>

493
00:21:36,034 --> 00:21:38,206
women get about,
like, what, their alliance.

494
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:40,344
She's like,
"Oh, they get specific.

495
00:21:40,448 --> 00:21:43,068
We're called the Breadwinners."

496
00:21:43,172 --> 00:21:44,862
- That's what they call it?
- Yeah.

497
00:21:44,965 --> 00:21:47,551
If she's
telling us the name, then...

498
00:21:47,655 --> 00:21:48,965
- we win.
- Wow.

499
00:21:49,068 --> 00:21:51,310
<i>The Breadwinners.
I haven't heard that before.</i>

500
00:21:51,413 --> 00:21:53,482
<i>Sierra and I,
we're supposed to be</i>

501
00:21:53,586 --> 00:21:55,275
<i>riding for each other,
no matter what.</i>

502
00:21:55,379 --> 00:21:58,068
Why are you not coming to me
with that kind of information?

503
00:21:58,172 --> 00:22:00,586
- You're my number one, so
I'm gonna tell you everything.
- Yeah.

504
00:22:00,689 --> 00:22:05,620
Andy tells me
that you told him about a...

505
00:22:05,724 --> 00:22:08,620
alliance name
that the three girls have.

506
00:22:08,724 --> 00:22:11,241
- Rachel said that she's
calling us the Breadwinners.
- Right.

507
00:22:11,344 --> 00:22:12,862
- I didn't come up with it.
- I don't care.

508
00:22:12,965 --> 00:22:14,275
- That's, like...
- I didn't come up with it.

509
00:22:14,379 --> 00:22:16,241
You know that
that's not where I'm going.

510
00:22:16,344 --> 00:22:18,896
- You know I have to play it off.
- I know, but if, you know,
if, like...

511
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,172
- Okay.
- No, but why didn't
you tell me that stuff?

512
00:22:21,275 --> 00:22:22,448
<i>
I didn't say,</i>

513
00:22:22,551 --> 00:22:24,275
"Hey, girls, let's
be called the Breadwinners."

514
00:22:24,379 --> 00:22:25,379
I didn't come up with that.

515
00:22:25,482 --> 00:22:27,448
<i>I'm going along with it</i>

516
00:22:27,551 --> 00:22:29,206
<i>because I'm doing what
I think is best for my game.</i>

517
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:31,000
Andy, right now, is...

518
00:22:31,103 --> 00:22:33,137
He-he scares me. I don't...

519
00:22:33,241 --> 00:22:34,379
Why?

520
00:22:34,482 --> 00:22:36,275
I don't think
Andy's gonna be loyal to me.

521
00:22:36,379 --> 00:22:37,793
But we don't
have to go with Andy yet.

522
00:22:37,896 --> 00:22:40,655
If-if we're at four, we can
always go with one of the girls.

523
00:22:40,758 --> 00:22:43,896
I don't know if that's
what makes sense for me either.

524
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,206
<i>
Sierra thinks</i>

525
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:48,344
Andy needs to go at the next
Tribal Council, and, uh,

526
00:22:48,448 --> 00:22:50,068
<i>that ain't gonna work for me.</i>

527
00:22:50,172 --> 00:22:51,689
<i>Keeping Andy is</i>

528
00:22:51,793 --> 00:22:54,310
absolutely essential to my game.

529
00:22:54,413 --> 00:22:57,310
I don't see a world
where it's the four of us,

530
00:22:57,413 --> 00:22:59,068
and the two of them
aren't wanting to get me out.

531
00:22:59,172 --> 00:23:01,448
Yeah, but that's not
gonna happen because of me.

532
00:23:01,551 --> 00:23:04,241
<i>Sam and I are just completely
bumping heads right now.</i>

533
00:23:04,344 --> 00:23:07,137
<i>We might need</i> Survivor's
<i>alliance therapy at this point</i>

534
00:23:07,241 --> 00:23:09,275
<i>because we're just going
back and forth, and I'm like,</i>

535
00:23:09,379 --> 00:23:10,655
"This is too early in the game

536
00:23:10,758 --> 00:23:12,655
to be bickering like
a freaking old married couple."

537
00:23:34,275 --> 00:23:35,689
Come on in.

538
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,620
Tuku and Gata getting your first
look at the new Lavo tribe.

539
00:23:48,586 --> 00:23:49,827
Aysha voted out...

540
00:23:49,931 --> 00:23:51,000
-Wow.
- Oh.

541
00:23:51,103 --> 00:23:52,655
...at the last Tribal Council.

542
00:23:52,758 --> 00:23:54,379
Well, well, well.

543
00:23:56,862 --> 00:23:59,000
All right, shall we get
to today's immunity challenge?

544
00:23:59,103 --> 00:24:00,310
- All right.

545
00:24:00,413 --> 00:24:02,758
First things first,
got to take back the idols.

546
00:24:02,862 --> 00:24:04,758
Thank you.

547
00:24:04,862 --> 00:24:07,310
- Thank you.
- Yes, sir.

548
00:24:12,586 --> 00:24:15,655
Once again,
immunity is back up for grabs.

549
00:24:17,655 --> 00:24:21,517
<i>For today's challenge, you're
gonna roll a heavy metal cube</i>

550
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:24,137
<i>to help you retrieve two bags.</i>

551
00:24:24,241 --> 00:24:26,517
<i>You'll use
the pieces inside the bags</i>

552
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:29,172
<i>to build a window frame
and then attempt to toss</i>

553
00:24:29,275 --> 00:24:31,965
<i>sandbags through the frame,
onto a barrel.</i>

554
00:24:32,068 --> 00:24:33,448
<i>If you knock the frame over,</i>

555
00:24:33,551 --> 00:24:35,551
<i>you got to rebuild it
and try again.</i>

556
00:24:35,655 --> 00:24:37,034
<i>Once you've
landed your sandbags,</i>

557
00:24:37,137 --> 00:24:39,896
<i>you'll then dig up a key,
open a gate.</i>

558
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,344
<i>That'll get you to the finish,</i>

559
00:24:41,448 --> 00:24:43,758
<i>where two tribe members
will work together to build</i>

560
00:24:43,862 --> 00:24:47,931
<i>a brand-new</i>
Survivor <i>fire puzzle.</i>

561
00:24:49,344 --> 00:24:51,655
First two tribes to finish
win immunity.

562
00:24:51,758 --> 00:24:54,620
Safe from the vote.
Nobody going home.

563
00:24:54,724 --> 00:24:56,689
- You will live to see day nine.

564
00:24:56,793 --> 00:24:58,655
In addition,
you're playing for a reward.

565
00:24:58,758 --> 00:24:59,931
Yes, come on.

566
00:25:00,034 --> 00:25:01,551
- Ladies and gents, let's go.

567
00:25:01,655 --> 00:25:03,931
Do I hear chickens or something?

568
00:25:04,034 --> 00:25:06,379
Or animals? I don't know.
I'm, like...

569
00:25:06,482 --> 00:25:08,586
- Oh...
- Oh, my goodness.

570
00:25:08,689 --> 00:25:09,724
First tribe to finish...

571
00:25:12,068 --> 00:25:14,137
- Oh, my God.

572
00:25:14,241 --> 00:25:16,379
Three egg-laying hens.

573
00:25:16,482 --> 00:25:18,172
- Egg-laying hens.
- Ah.

574
00:25:18,275 --> 00:25:19,517
Second tribe to finish...

575
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:24,586
...six eggs from
the three egg-laying hens.

576
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:26,034
- Oh, my God, man.
- Wow.

577
00:25:26,137 --> 00:25:27,206
- Okay. All right. Okay.
-Last tribe to finish,

578
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:28,896
otherwise known as the losers,

579
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,310
got nothing for you but a date
with me at Tribal Council,

580
00:25:32,413 --> 00:25:34,965
where somebody
will be the fourth person

581
00:25:35,068 --> 00:25:36,517
voted out of <i>Survivor</i> 47.

582
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:39,068
And as a penalty for losing,
I will take your flint.

583
00:25:39,172 --> 00:25:41,241
Lavo, you are working
to earn yours back.

584
00:25:41,344 --> 00:25:43,379
All right, we have no sit-outs.

585
00:25:43,482 --> 00:25:45,310
We are even.
Five across the board.

586
00:25:45,413 --> 00:25:46,448
Give you a minute to strategize.

587
00:25:46,551 --> 00:25:47,586
We'll get it on. Let's do it.

588
00:25:47,689 --> 00:25:48,758
Let's get it on.

589
00:25:55,793 --> 00:25:57,689
All right, here we go.

590
00:25:57,793 --> 00:26:00,172
For immunity and reward.

591
00:26:00,275 --> 00:26:02,137
Survivors ready?

592
00:26:03,517 --> 00:26:04,517
Go!

593
00:26:05,586 --> 00:26:08,482
First, you got
to move a very heavy cube.

594
00:26:08,586 --> 00:26:11,137
It's gonna
take everything you got.

595
00:26:11,241 --> 00:26:13,206
Push, push. Go, go.

596
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:15,206
Make sure you don't run
into somebody else with it,

597
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:16,862
'cause it will hurt.

598
00:26:16,965 --> 00:26:18,448
-Ride the bounce.
Ride the bounce...
-We got it.

599
00:26:18,551 --> 00:26:20,241
- Great job.
-Ride the bounce.
Ride the bounce.

600
00:26:20,344 --> 00:26:21,241
Keep rolling.

601
00:26:21,344 --> 00:26:22,586
Tuku doing a nice job.

602
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,620
Watch your feet.

603
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:29,068
You got to get
it underneath the first bag...

604
00:26:29,172 --> 00:26:31,896
- ...so you can get somebody
up top to retrieve that bag.

605
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,931
-Go.
- Lavo doing a nice job.

606
00:26:34,034 --> 00:26:36,551
They're under that first bag,
sorta.
-Nice, Rome.

607
00:26:36,655 --> 00:26:38,862
Rome going up top
to unclip that first bag.

608
00:26:38,965 --> 00:26:40,482
Gata's at the first bag.

609
00:26:40,586 --> 00:26:42,137
Tuku still going.

610
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:44,655
Unclip. You don't need to untie.

611
00:26:44,758 --> 00:26:46,689
Rome's got it for Lavo.

612
00:26:46,793 --> 00:26:48,620
-Get up there.
-Anika going up
for Gata.

613
00:26:48,724 --> 00:26:50,689
Kyle going up for Tuku.

614
00:26:50,793 --> 00:26:51,689
Anika has the bag.

615
00:26:51,793 --> 00:26:53,172
Kyle has the bag.

616
00:26:53,275 --> 00:26:55,413
Once you get that bag, get down.

617
00:26:55,517 --> 00:26:56,517
Do not dillydally.

618
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:58,931
You're taking too much time.

619
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:01,413
-Yep, you got it.
-Now you got to move it
to the other bag.

620
00:27:01,517 --> 00:27:04,241
- Rome has it. Get down, Rome.
-Jump down. Jump down.

621
00:27:04,344 --> 00:27:05,310
Yeah, Kyle.

622
00:27:05,413 --> 00:27:06,620
Tuku has their second bag.

623
00:27:06,724 --> 00:27:07,758
Drop it. Drop it.

624
00:27:07,862 --> 00:27:08,862
-Gata has theirs.
-Sorry.

625
00:27:08,965 --> 00:27:10,482
It's gonna be Sol and Kyle...

626
00:27:10,586 --> 00:27:12,172
Go all the way up, Kyle.

627
00:27:12,275 --> 00:27:13,931
- ...and Sam.
- Nice, Sol.

628
00:27:14,034 --> 00:27:15,413
You've got to empty those bags.

629
00:27:15,517 --> 00:27:17,034
-Doing amazing.
- You're gonna find two sandbags

630
00:27:17,137 --> 00:27:20,000
and the pieces you need
to make this window frame

631
00:27:20,103 --> 00:27:22,103
- that you're gonna
throw the sandbags through.
-Good job, Kyle.

632
00:27:22,206 --> 00:27:24,172
-Great job.
-Kyle has
his pieces free.

633
00:27:24,275 --> 00:27:25,241
Starts building the frame.

634
00:27:25,344 --> 00:27:27,413
Sol has his pieces free.

635
00:27:27,517 --> 00:27:28,655
That's the top.

636
00:27:28,758 --> 00:27:29,862
-That goes on top.
-Go, Kyle.

637
00:27:29,965 --> 00:27:32,206
Kyle can start for Tuku
with his first toss.

638
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:33,655
All right,
take your time, brother.

639
00:27:33,758 --> 00:27:35,034
Take your time.

640
00:27:35,137 --> 00:27:37,068
On and off. Another toss.

641
00:27:37,172 --> 00:27:38,068
Just misses.

642
00:27:38,172 --> 00:27:39,103
There you go, Sam.

643
00:27:39,206 --> 00:27:40,413
Sam has all the pieces.

644
00:27:40,517 --> 00:27:42,413
He can start building the frame.

645
00:27:42,517 --> 00:27:43,793
- Kyle tosses.

646
00:27:43,896 --> 00:27:45,793
No good.

647
00:27:45,896 --> 00:27:47,793
Kyle,
that sandbag will not count.

648
00:27:47,896 --> 00:27:49,862
It's got to be a clean toss.

649
00:27:49,965 --> 00:27:51,586
You got it, Sol.

650
00:27:51,689 --> 00:27:54,206
- Yeah!
-Sol with the first one.

651
00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:56,551
- Sol with two in a row...

652
00:27:56,655 --> 00:27:57,689
- This now, right?
- ...for Lavo.

653
00:27:57,793 --> 00:27:58,724
Wow!

654
00:27:58,827 --> 00:27:59,827
All right, pull the corners.

655
00:27:59,931 --> 00:28:02,034
Two tosses. Sol landed 'em both.

656
00:28:02,137 --> 00:28:03,344
- You're made for this, Sam.
-Here goes Sam.

657
00:28:03,448 --> 00:28:04,310
- Sam sticks one.
- Nice.

658
00:28:04,413 --> 00:28:05,448
There we go, Sam.

659
00:28:05,551 --> 00:28:07,448
-Kyle sticks one.

660
00:28:07,551 --> 00:28:10,000
- Sol gave Lavo a big lead.

661
00:28:11,724 --> 00:28:13,344
Sam, you're good.
Let's go, Gata.

662
00:28:13,448 --> 00:28:14,965
- You're good, Kyle.
-Beautiful.

663
00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:16,068
Let's go, Tuku.

664
00:28:16,172 --> 00:28:17,620
TIYANA
Sandbags, sandbags, sandbags.

665
00:28:17,724 --> 00:28:20,206
Everybody working
on the sandbags now.

666
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:23,896
- You got to get all
the sandbags to your platform.

667
00:28:24,896 --> 00:28:26,103
They are very heavy.

668
00:28:26,206 --> 00:28:27,517
They are very heavy.

669
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:29,689
You cannot start digging
until you have all

670
00:28:29,793 --> 00:28:31,689
your sandbags on your platform.

671
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:34,275
Lavo, you're good.
Start digging.

672
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:35,655
Let's go, guys. Come on.

673
00:28:35,758 --> 00:28:37,275
-We're good.

674
00:28:37,379 --> 00:28:39,172
- Jeff?
- You're good. You're good.

675
00:28:39,275 --> 00:28:40,275
- Dig.
-Come on.

676
00:28:40,379 --> 00:28:41,310
Let's go, let's go, let's go,
let's go.

677
00:28:41,413 --> 00:28:43,172
Now all three tribes
are in this.

678
00:28:43,275 --> 00:28:45,448
- Two hands.
-Now everybody's
digging.

679
00:28:45,551 --> 00:28:46,689
Two hands.

680
00:28:46,793 --> 00:28:47,896
Oh, I feel something.
Feel it.

681
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,655
- Yeah. Good job.
- Nice. Let's go, baby.

682
00:28:49,758 --> 00:28:51,103
Lavo has their key.

683
00:28:51,206 --> 00:28:52,517
Gata has their key.

684
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:54,379
- Tuku has their key.
- Pull it!

685
00:28:54,482 --> 00:28:56,103
Pull it, pull it, pull it.

686
00:28:56,206 --> 00:28:57,862
We are dead even right now...

687
00:28:57,965 --> 00:28:59,206
Oh, there's multiple keys?

688
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:00,758
...as we head into the final
stage of this challenge.

689
00:29:00,862 --> 00:29:01,827
Unlock it. Unlock it.

690
00:29:01,931 --> 00:29:03,517
Unlock it. Yeah.

691
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:06,000
You're good, Lavo.
Lavo's through.

692
00:29:06,103 --> 00:29:07,310
They can start
working on the puzzle.

693
00:29:07,413 --> 00:29:08,896
- Gabe has it for Tuku.
- Yeah, go.

694
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,241
You can work on your puzzle,
Tuku.

695
00:29:11,344 --> 00:29:13,586
Gata's through.
You can work on your puzzle.

696
00:29:13,689 --> 00:29:15,758
-Okay, babe.
-All right,
here we go, baby.

697
00:29:15,862 --> 00:29:18,344
-It's gonna be
Caroline and Gabe for Tuku.
-Let's go, guys.

698
00:29:18,448 --> 00:29:21,206
Rome and Genevieve for Lavo.

699
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:24,965
Anika and Rachel for Gata.

700
00:29:25,068 --> 00:29:26,379
Okay.

701
00:29:26,482 --> 00:29:28,413
Day eight.
You want to get to day nine.

702
00:29:28,517 --> 00:29:30,413
- It's right here.
-Oh, yeah, it is.
Yeah, it is.

703
00:29:30,517 --> 00:29:32,310
Caroline gets
the first piece for Tuku.

704
00:29:32,413 --> 00:29:33,793
-Nice.
Way to go, Rachel.
- Yes.

705
00:29:33,896 --> 00:29:37,034
And Rachel with the first piece
for Gata.

706
00:29:37,137 --> 00:29:38,758
- Rome's trying
to get the first piece.
- Right hand!

707
00:29:38,862 --> 00:29:40,793
He's taking the throne position.

708
00:29:40,896 --> 00:29:43,965
- He will be handed pieces
by Genevieve.
-I got this one.

709
00:29:44,068 --> 00:29:44,965
Got it.

710
00:29:45,068 --> 00:29:46,413
Yeah, Caroline!

711
00:29:46,517 --> 00:29:48,379
- You got it?
-It is Gata and Tuku

712
00:29:48,482 --> 00:29:49,758
- moving quickly.
- Yes. Good job, Ani.

713
00:29:49,862 --> 00:29:51,482
-Yeah, that's it.
That's it.
- Move.

714
00:29:51,586 --> 00:29:53,965
Rome still looking
for that first piece for Lavo.

715
00:29:54,068 --> 00:29:55,827
It's either gonna be that
or something similar to that

716
00:29:55,931 --> 00:29:57,206
on the left side.

717
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:59,620
That first piece gives you
an idea

718
00:29:59,724 --> 00:30:02,758
of how these pieces go together.

719
00:30:02,862 --> 00:30:04,586
Once you get it,
it gets a little easier.

720
00:30:04,689 --> 00:30:07,620
Great job, Caroline.

721
00:30:07,724 --> 00:30:10,103
Not... That is not it,
either side.

722
00:30:10,206 --> 00:30:12,862
Once again on the puzzle,
it is Tuku

723
00:30:12,965 --> 00:30:14,689
and Gata in a showdown.

724
00:30:14,793 --> 00:30:16,517
- Thataway, Rach.
-It is Gata in the lead.

725
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:18,655
- I got it.
-Then Tuku.
-Beautiful, Caroline.

726
00:30:18,758 --> 00:30:20,241
And then dead last,

727
00:30:20,344 --> 00:30:23,413
without a single spark
of flame, it is Lavo.

728
00:30:23,517 --> 00:30:25,310
We just need our first piece.

729
00:30:25,413 --> 00:30:27,931
Nope, not it, Rome.

730
00:30:28,034 --> 00:30:29,241
-There you go, girls.
-Great job, girls.

731
00:30:29,344 --> 00:30:31,344
Gata continues
to expand on their lead.

732
00:30:31,448 --> 00:30:32,724
Gata looking very good
right now.

733
00:30:32,827 --> 00:30:34,241
- Got it.
-Another piece for Tuku.

734
00:30:34,344 --> 00:30:35,689
Yes, Gabe.

735
00:30:36,724 --> 00:30:39,068
-Same story at Lavo.
- Not it, Rome.

736
00:30:39,172 --> 00:30:41,689
Now you start
to question, "What is wrong?"

737
00:30:41,793 --> 00:30:44,551
Not it, Rome.
Why can I not
get a piece to fit?

738
00:30:44,655 --> 00:30:46,379
That is not the piece, Rome.

739
00:30:46,482 --> 00:30:48,586
Not even one piece.

740
00:30:48,689 --> 00:30:50,517
- That's not it.
- That's not it.

741
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:53,482
Meanwhile, Rachel and Anika
making it look easy.

742
00:30:53,586 --> 00:30:55,206
You're doing so amazingly well.

743
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:57,172
Like assassins, piece by piece,
one after the other.

744
00:30:57,275 --> 00:30:59,586
- Caroline
with another piece for Tuku.
- Great job, Caroline.

745
00:30:59,689 --> 00:31:02,344
You guys want to switch roles?

746
00:31:05,379 --> 00:31:06,586
There you go, girls.

747
00:31:06,689 --> 00:31:08,275
- Way to go, guys. You killed it.
- Finish it off.

748
00:31:08,379 --> 00:31:10,206
Gata down to their last piece.

749
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,206
-That is it.
What a calm finish.
- Great job.

750
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:17,241
Gata wins immunity
and the chickens for reward.

751
00:31:17,344 --> 00:31:20,551
- We got chickens.
-We're now
looking for one more.

752
00:31:20,655 --> 00:31:23,965
Very similar
to the last challenge

753
00:31:24,068 --> 00:31:28,689
where Lavo was struggling to get
anything going on the puzzle.

754
00:31:28,793 --> 00:31:30,551
That's not it, Rome.

755
00:31:30,655 --> 00:31:32,655
Rome's plopped in front
of the puzzle

756
00:31:32,758 --> 00:31:34,413
and has made no progress
with Genevieve.

757
00:31:34,517 --> 00:31:35,862
Come on, Jeff.

758
00:31:35,965 --> 00:31:38,034
One after another,
trying every piece.

759
00:31:38,137 --> 00:31:40,379
Nothing is sticking.
No changes made.

760
00:31:40,482 --> 00:31:43,724
No assessment,
reassessment, nothing.

761
00:31:43,827 --> 00:31:45,551
Tuku getting closer.

762
00:31:47,482 --> 00:31:49,620
Oh, my God. Kill me now.

763
00:31:52,517 --> 00:31:57,103
Gabe leaving Caroline
to finish it for Tuku.

764
00:31:57,206 --> 00:31:58,241
Oh, my God.

765
00:31:58,344 --> 00:32:00,448
Lavo just gonna watch?

766
00:32:01,793 --> 00:32:04,310
There it is.
Tuku wins immunity

767
00:32:04,413 --> 00:32:07,620
and six eggs, sending Lavo

768
00:32:07,724 --> 00:32:09,827
back to Tribal Council

769
00:32:09,931 --> 00:32:11,172
for the second straight time,

770
00:32:11,275 --> 00:32:12,896
where somebody will be
the fourth person

771
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,724
voted out of <i>Survivor</i> 47.

772
00:32:16,413 --> 00:32:17,827
A rare, rare visual.

773
00:32:17,931 --> 00:32:20,862
A puzzle that ended
the same way it started,

774
00:32:20,965 --> 00:32:23,034
as if it never happened.

775
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:28,689
All right, Gata,
another convincing victory.

776
00:32:28,793 --> 00:32:31,068
-Good job, guys.

777
00:32:31,172 --> 00:32:33,862
- Good job.
-Once again,
immunity is yours.

778
00:32:33,965 --> 00:32:36,206
Nobody going home,
no Tribal Council tonight.

779
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:38,206
In addition,
waiting for you back at camp--

780
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:40,793
three egg-laying hens.

781
00:32:40,896 --> 00:32:43,793
Well done.
Tuku also finished.

782
00:32:43,896 --> 00:32:46,137
- Wins immunity.

783
00:32:46,241 --> 00:32:47,896
Once again, safe from the vote.

784
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,310
Waiting for you back at camp--

785
00:32:49,413 --> 00:32:53,655
six eggs from those three
egg-laying hens.

786
00:32:53,758 --> 00:32:56,275
All right,
before I send you off,

787
00:32:56,379 --> 00:32:57,448
we have a journey.

788
00:32:57,551 --> 00:32:58,793
Gata, you're in charge.

789
00:32:58,896 --> 00:33:00,586
You're gonna send somebody
from each tribe.

790
00:33:00,689 --> 00:33:03,344
It cannot be somebody
who's already been on a journey.

791
00:33:03,448 --> 00:33:05,482
So first take a moment and tell
us who's going from your tribe.

792
00:33:05,586 --> 00:33:07,724
- It's gonna be Andy.

793
00:33:07,827 --> 00:33:11,000
All right, now,
who's gonna join Andy from Lavo?

794
00:33:11,103 --> 00:33:12,482
Teeny.

795
00:33:13,517 --> 00:33:16,344
All right, Andy,
who's gonna join you from Tuku?

796
00:33:16,448 --> 00:33:18,482
- We're gonna pick Caroline.
-Caroline.

797
00:33:18,586 --> 00:33:20,310
- All right.
-Okay, Andy,

798
00:33:20,413 --> 00:33:23,172
Teeny, Caroline,
grab your stuff, head out.

799
00:33:23,275 --> 00:33:24,827
You will return back
to your camp

800
00:33:24,931 --> 00:33:27,413
- in time for Tribal Council.
- Bye, guys.

801
00:33:30,103 --> 00:33:31,655
-Good luck. Good luck.
-All right,

802
00:33:31,758 --> 00:33:33,275
Gata, Tuku, grab your stuff,
head back to camp.

803
00:33:33,379 --> 00:33:36,551
No Tribal Council tonight.
Nobody going home.

804
00:33:36,655 --> 00:33:38,137
Yes, sir.

805
00:33:41,137 --> 00:33:44,655
All right, Lavo,
let's first just talk.

806
00:33:44,758 --> 00:33:47,931
Rome and Genevieve,
describe that frustration

807
00:33:48,034 --> 00:33:50,034
because it's very different
when you're out here.

808
00:33:50,137 --> 00:33:52,827
I've never tried to do a puzzle
under these conditions

809
00:33:52,931 --> 00:33:54,965
- and with that pressure.
-So, you know,

810
00:33:55,068 --> 00:33:56,344
the two times I've been
at the end of a challenge,

811
00:33:56,448 --> 00:33:57,689
I've been able to clutch it up.

812
00:33:57,793 --> 00:33:59,517
So I felt confident
that I would be able

813
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:01,413
to, you know,
potentially do this.

814
00:34:01,517 --> 00:34:02,862
And then, you know,
your family's gonna be

815
00:34:02,965 --> 00:34:04,172
seeing you try to do a puzzle

816
00:34:04,275 --> 00:34:05,862
and not be able
to get one piece,

817
00:34:05,965 --> 00:34:07,827
and it's just...
it's just really embarrassing.

818
00:34:07,931 --> 00:34:09,586
All right, Lavo,

819
00:34:09,689 --> 00:34:11,862
Tribal Council tonight,
where somebody will be

820
00:34:11,965 --> 00:34:13,241
the fourth person
voted out of <i>Survivor</i> 47.

821
00:34:13,344 --> 00:34:15,724
As a penalty for losing,
I will keep your flint.

822
00:34:15,827 --> 00:34:18,448
You'll have a chance to earn it
back at the next challenge.

823
00:34:18,551 --> 00:34:21,137
All right, head out. See you
tonight at Tribal Council.

824
00:34:21,241 --> 00:34:23,172
<i>
Losing today's challenge</i>

825
00:34:23,275 --> 00:34:26,896
and the way
we lost it really sucked.

826
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,655
<i>While the other tribes
might be enjoying chickens</i>

827
00:34:29,758 --> 00:34:32,241
<i>and having scrambled eggs,
we've got Tribal Council,</i>

828
00:34:32,344 --> 00:34:34,068
<i>and we are going to be having
a straight-up scramble</i>

829
00:34:34,172 --> 00:34:36,413
<i>to see who goes home, so...</i>

830
00:34:36,517 --> 00:34:39,000
not great. Not great.

831
00:34:44,896 --> 00:34:47,000
Ah, it's so easy
when you're sitting at home,

832
00:34:47,103 --> 00:34:49,241
but when you're out here
in Fiji,

833
00:34:49,344 --> 00:34:50,793
it is a whole different game.

834
00:34:50,896 --> 00:34:53,379
Think you could solve this
puzzle? Apply to be on <i>Survivor.</i>

835
00:35:02,586 --> 00:35:04,413
- Four for five.
- Yes.

836
00:35:04,517 --> 00:35:05,724
Four Ws.
Look, we have an egg in there!

837
00:35:08,655 --> 00:35:10,586
Hello, are you the animals?

838
00:35:10,689 --> 00:35:13,310
<i>The idea of eating,
like, some juicy,</i>

839
00:35:13,413 --> 00:35:16,793
hot chicken right now
just makes me want

840
00:35:16,896 --> 00:35:19,172
to just die in a pool of drool.

841
00:35:19,275 --> 00:35:22,689
<i>But there are politics involved
in whether</i>

842
00:35:22,793 --> 00:35:24,517
to kill
or not kill the chickens.

843
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:26,862
We do have to feed them
to keep 'em strong.

844
00:35:26,965 --> 00:35:28,620
Is anybody opposed
to just eating them?

845
00:35:28,724 --> 00:35:30,172
They can eat grass.

846
00:35:30,275 --> 00:35:33,137
So I kind of...
I-I... I don't know.

847
00:35:33,241 --> 00:35:34,275
I want eggs.

848
00:35:35,896 --> 00:35:37,896
I'd rather keep getting meals
out of them.

849
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
- I think so, too.
- Yeah.
- And that's protein.

850
00:35:40,103 --> 00:35:41,689
I do want to eat one
at one point.

851
00:35:41,793 --> 00:35:43,034
There's a lot of meat there.

852
00:35:43,137 --> 00:35:44,379
<i>
I cannot</i>

853
00:35:44,482 --> 00:35:46,172
kill the chickens.
Like, I can't do this.

854
00:35:46,275 --> 00:35:48,655
<i>Chickens are near and dear
to my heart.</i>

855
00:35:48,758 --> 00:35:50,689
<i>We go to wineries
that have chickens.</i>

856
00:35:50,793 --> 00:35:53,379
I feed them,
I hold them, I pet them.

857
00:35:53,482 --> 00:35:54,620
I love chickens.

858
00:35:54,724 --> 00:35:55,758
- Oh!

859
00:35:57,482 --> 00:36:00,241
- Oh, my God.
- Sounds like he's got to go.

860
00:36:00,344 --> 00:36:01,793
No.

861
00:36:01,896 --> 00:36:03,206
<i>
My first thought</i>

862
00:36:03,310 --> 00:36:05,206
when we win is, "Thank you!

863
00:36:05,310 --> 00:36:06,655
Some food, some protein."

864
00:36:06,758 --> 00:36:10,206
<i>But Sierra doesn't want
to kill the chickens.</i>

865
00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:13,137
<i>She wants to just wait around
and hope that there's gonna be</i>

866
00:36:13,241 --> 00:36:15,103
dozens and dozens of eggs
that hatch.

867
00:36:15,206 --> 00:36:16,379
-Sam!
- What?

868
00:36:16,482 --> 00:36:17,586
The chicken's out!

869
00:36:17,689 --> 00:36:19,965
Grab the chicken!

870
00:36:20,068 --> 00:36:21,551
<i>
I'm eight days without food.</i>

871
00:36:21,655 --> 00:36:24,103
I don't care anymore.
Just give me the green light,

872
00:36:24,206 --> 00:36:25,896
and that chicken, uh, will...

873
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,793
You know,
it's going to the butcher shop.

874
00:36:42,137 --> 00:36:43,517
Well, that was embarrassing.

875
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:45,310
That was very embarrassing.

876
00:36:45,413 --> 00:36:47,724
- I think we just
collectively know...
-Yeah.

877
00:36:47,827 --> 00:36:49,310
- ...we're not good...
- At puzzles.

878
00:36:49,413 --> 00:36:52,000
...at those type...
those types of puzzles.

879
00:36:52,103 --> 00:36:55,620
<i>
I put myself in the final
position to do the puzzle.</i>

880
00:36:55,724 --> 00:36:57,310
I definitely want
to be the person

881
00:36:57,413 --> 00:36:58,655
that's in that clutch role.

882
00:36:58,758 --> 00:37:01,068
Yeah, not getting one piece
was demoralizing.

883
00:37:01,172 --> 00:37:02,793
Yeah.

884
00:37:02,896 --> 00:37:04,379
<i>
And honestly, I was just</i>

885
00:37:04,482 --> 00:37:06,068
absolutely awful.

886
00:37:06,172 --> 00:37:09,241
All right, well,
you guys ready to go wash off?

887
00:37:09,344 --> 00:37:10,551
I don't know
if I'm gonna go in the water.

888
00:37:10,655 --> 00:37:12,103
It's so chilly.

889
00:37:12,206 --> 00:37:13,620
I don't think
I'm gonna go in the water.

890
00:37:13,724 --> 00:37:16,379
<i>Fortunately,
I have faith in the core four.</i>

891
00:37:16,482 --> 00:37:18,931
<i>So even though Gata chose Teeny
to go on the journey,</i>

892
00:37:19,034 --> 00:37:20,827
<i>in our heads
we already know the game plan.</i>

893
00:37:20,931 --> 00:37:22,482
It's gonna be Sol.

894
00:37:22,586 --> 00:37:24,310
It's just
about how it goes down.

895
00:37:24,413 --> 00:37:25,862
So we all know the plan.

896
00:37:25,965 --> 00:37:29,793
It just sucks
that it had to happen now.

897
00:37:33,068 --> 00:37:35,034
I feel like
I should at this point.

898
00:37:37,586 --> 00:37:39,827
<i>
I still have the Steal a Vote
in my pocket,</i>

899
00:37:39,931 --> 00:37:42,586
<i>so, if I feel like Sol might
play his Shot in the Dark,</i>

900
00:37:42,689 --> 00:37:44,586
<i>guess what.
I can use the Steal a Vote</i>

901
00:37:44,689 --> 00:37:46,413
<i>and make sure he can't play
his Shot in the Dark,</i>

902
00:37:46,517 --> 00:37:47,689
because you have to have a vote

903
00:37:47,793 --> 00:37:48,827
in order
to play a Shot in the Dark.

904
00:37:48,931 --> 00:37:51,206
I'd rather try and convince him

905
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:53,448
- of another plan
and at least see how he...
- If he bites?

906
00:37:53,551 --> 00:37:56,103
Like, we can get a vibe
whether he believes it or not.

907
00:37:56,206 --> 00:37:58,275
<i>But the thing is, I don't want
to use this Steal a Vote,</i>

908
00:37:58,379 --> 00:38:02,137
<i>because if we, as an alliance,
can keep this advantage,</i>

909
00:38:02,241 --> 00:38:05,896
then we'll be sitting really
pretty heading into the merge.

910
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,034
I do think
we can maybe give him a name

911
00:38:08,137 --> 00:38:10,275
and make him feel comfortable.

912
00:38:10,379 --> 00:38:12,448
Does Genevieve sound believable?

913
00:38:12,551 --> 00:38:16,758
<i>'Cause we could always push,
like, we need tribe strength.</i>

914
00:38:16,862 --> 00:38:18,275
We feel she's given the least.

915
00:38:18,379 --> 00:38:20,206
That's probably
the most believable.

916
00:38:20,310 --> 00:38:22,862
<i>
Rome proposes,
"Let's maybe try to see</i>

917
00:38:22,965 --> 00:38:25,172
<i>"if we can comfort Sol
in this fake plan</i>

918
00:38:25,275 --> 00:38:26,517
<i>that the vote is gonna be
on someone else."</i>

919
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:27,862
<i>And I was like,</i>

920
00:38:27,965 --> 00:38:29,275
"Maybe. What about Genevieve?

921
00:38:29,379 --> 00:38:31,034
"You know,
strength is a big issue.

922
00:38:31,137 --> 00:38:32,448
So what if we say Genevieve?"

923
00:38:32,551 --> 00:38:33,931
Just 'cause
I do not want my name heard.

924
00:38:34,034 --> 00:38:35,620
It hasn't been heard yet.
I don't want it out there.

925
00:38:35,724 --> 00:38:37,965
Do you think there's any way
we could convince him

926
00:38:38,068 --> 00:38:39,620
to give up his Shot in the Dark?

927
00:38:39,724 --> 00:38:42,689
Be like, "I am taking your vote
if you don't vote with us."

928
00:38:42,793 --> 00:38:45,000
- Yeah.
- And we can say
that it's gonna be Genevieve.

929
00:38:45,103 --> 00:38:46,724
Like, I could just
straight-up threaten him.

930
00:38:46,827 --> 00:38:49,137
I'd have no problem doing that.

931
00:38:49,241 --> 00:38:51,379
Yeah. That works.

932
00:38:51,482 --> 00:38:53,517
Anything that works.

933
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:55,068
I feel actually
pretty good about that.

934
00:38:55,172 --> 00:38:56,758
<i>
It might be a little villainous.</i>

935
00:38:56,862 --> 00:38:58,724
<i>You know,
I could strong-arm Sol tonight,</i>

936
00:38:58,827 --> 00:39:00,137
<i>and little does he know</i>

937
00:39:00,241 --> 00:39:01,551
that he's gonna be
gone regardless.

938
00:39:01,655 --> 00:39:02,862
But at the end of the day,
at least

939
00:39:02,965 --> 00:39:04,379
I'll let him choose
how he goes out.

940
00:39:07,241 --> 00:39:08,482
- What?
- Just-just wait, just...

941
00:39:08,586 --> 00:39:09,862
<i>I feel like if I give him</i>

942
00:39:09,965 --> 00:39:12,724
that ultimatum, I feel like
he might actually break.

943
00:39:12,827 --> 00:39:14,827
It's more than likely
gonna be you tonight.

944
00:39:14,931 --> 00:39:17,517
But hear me out. I'm willing
to work with you for this vote

945
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:19,689
to make it the way
that we want to.

946
00:39:19,793 --> 00:39:22,620
The way that we'll be able
to do it is because

947
00:39:22,724 --> 00:39:25,586
- I have a Steal a Vote.
- Dude.

948
00:39:25,689 --> 00:39:28,448
I will use this Steal a Vote
on Genevieve tonight.

949
00:39:28,551 --> 00:39:29,896
But the only way
that I'm doing that,

950
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,241
- and I'm letting you
know that...
- Yeah?

951
00:39:31,344 --> 00:39:32,724
...is if you give me
your Shot in the Dark.

952
00:39:32,827 --> 00:39:34,241
I'm letting you know,
if you don't

953
00:39:34,344 --> 00:39:36,034
give me your Shot in the Dark,
I'm using the Steal a Vote

954
00:39:36,137 --> 00:39:37,586
on you tonight, and then

955
00:39:37,689 --> 00:39:39,655
you can't play
your Shot in the Dark anyway.

956
00:39:39,758 --> 00:39:42,275
I'm letting you know that right
now, and you'll be going home.

957
00:39:42,379 --> 00:39:45,413
- I have the advantage...
- What are you talking about, bro?

958
00:39:45,517 --> 00:39:47,034
You're, like,
threatening me right now.

959
00:39:47,137 --> 00:39:50,344
This isn't a threat. I'm just
letting you know the situation.

960
00:39:50,448 --> 00:39:53,931
- Is this real life, bro?
- This is <i>Survivor,</i> bro.

961
00:39:54,034 --> 00:39:55,931
<i>
I was like, "Bro, really?
It's like,</i>

962
00:39:56,034 --> 00:39:57,172
<i>you can't be
threatening people."</i>

963
00:39:57,275 --> 00:39:58,344
<i>But, you know,</i>

964
00:39:58,448 --> 00:40:00,000
the villain
on this season is Rome.

965
00:40:01,034 --> 00:40:02,896
"Congratulations.
This advantage allows you

966
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,551
"to steal a vote
from another player

967
00:40:04,655 --> 00:40:07,379
at Tribal Council." Blah-blah-
blah-blah-blah-blah-blah.

968
00:40:07,482 --> 00:40:09,137
<i>
It's a slap in the face,
'cause, uh,</i>

969
00:40:09,241 --> 00:40:11,241
nobody,
especially of Rome's size,

970
00:40:11,344 --> 00:40:15,206
<i>has ever talked to me
the way he has,</i>

971
00:40:15,310 --> 00:40:18,655
<i>and I don't plan on working
with him ever in this game.</i>

972
00:40:18,758 --> 00:40:20,862
And then here's the thing.
Here's the thing.

973
00:40:20,965 --> 00:40:22,206
- How can I...?
- That's fine.

974
00:40:22,310 --> 00:40:23,586
If you don't want to do it,
that's fine.

975
00:40:23,689 --> 00:40:24,896
I'm using my Steal a Vote
on you tonight,

976
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,241
and you'll be going home.

977
00:40:26,344 --> 00:40:27,896
I can't believe
you're doing this to me, dawg.

978
00:40:29,896 --> 00:40:31,379
Down to the water.

979
00:40:31,482 --> 00:40:33,206
- To what?
- The water.

980
00:40:33,310 --> 00:40:34,689
<i>-You just threatened me.
-That's not a threat.</i>

981
00:40:34,793 --> 00:40:35,689
It's an ultimatum.
That's not a threat.

982
00:40:35,793 --> 00:40:37,241
- That's an ultimatum.
- Oh, okay.

983
00:40:37,344 --> 00:40:38,689
- An ultimatum is not a threat.
- Okay. My bad.

984
00:40:38,793 --> 00:40:40,000
My fault.

985
00:40:41,931 --> 00:40:43,862
<i>
You know, the obvious vote is,
we vote for Sol,</i>

986
00:40:43,965 --> 00:40:46,758
<i>and then, on the other hand,
you have Rome.</i>

987
00:40:46,862 --> 00:40:48,206
<i>His thing is,</i>

988
00:40:48,310 --> 00:40:51,379
"It's my show.
You know, Lavo is Rome."

989
00:40:51,482 --> 00:40:53,344
<i>And I'm starting
to get sick of it.</i>

990
00:40:53,448 --> 00:40:56,551
<i>He's playing chaotically.
That scares me.</i>

991
00:40:56,655 --> 00:40:58,931
You know, I can trust him now.
Can I trust him

992
00:40:59,034 --> 00:41:00,517
<i>in the future?</i>

993
00:41:05,379 --> 00:41:07,482
- Yeah.
- Even if he steals a vote,

994
00:41:07,586 --> 00:41:09,655
- that's two votes on Sol.
- Yeah.

995
00:41:09,758 --> 00:41:13,931
Even if Teeny loses her vote,
if us two vote Rome...

996
00:41:18,517 --> 00:41:20,620
- And it's...
- Rome will die. He will die.

997
00:41:20,724 --> 00:41:23,206
- I know.
- You're...
I can see you grinning.

998
00:41:23,310 --> 00:41:26,793
- Bad boy. Bad boy.
- Ooh.

999
00:41:26,896 --> 00:41:28,965
- Naughty, naughty.
- Naughty, naughty.

1000
00:41:29,068 --> 00:41:31,275
<i>
I want to switch the vote
onto Rome because</i>

1001
00:41:31,379 --> 00:41:33,206
<i>I think
the true benefit of this is</i>

1002
00:41:33,310 --> 00:41:35,241
Rome is super tight
with Genevieve.

1003
00:41:35,344 --> 00:41:37,068
<i>Once Rome's gone,
that leaves Genevieve</i>

1004
00:41:37,172 --> 00:41:38,689
<i>in a really vulnerable position.</i>

1005
00:41:40,172 --> 00:41:41,586
Okay.

1006
00:41:43,241 --> 00:41:45,172
Dude, I'm ready
to go to Tribal now.

1007
00:41:45,275 --> 00:41:47,551
<i>
If we get out Rome, and
we let Sol in, into the plan,</i>

1008
00:41:47,655 --> 00:41:50,172
<i>Sol now trusts me because</i>

1009
00:41:50,275 --> 00:41:51,689
I have created the plan
to save him.

1010
00:41:51,793 --> 00:41:54,482
He is going
to be completely shocked.

1011
00:41:54,586 --> 00:41:58,931
If this happens,
this will feel so... good.

1012
00:41:59,034 --> 00:42:00,275
Okay.

1013
00:42:00,379 --> 00:42:01,793
- It's going to happen.
- Okay. Yeah.

1014
00:42:01,896 --> 00:42:03,827
<i>This is one of the best feelings
in the world.</i>

1015
00:42:03,931 --> 00:42:05,379
<i>Rome is the vote.</i>

1016
00:42:05,482 --> 00:42:07,724
<i>He's going to have no clue.
I'm so happy.</i>

1017
00:42:09,413 --> 00:42:11,103
<i>At tonight's Tribal,</i>

1018
00:42:11,206 --> 00:42:13,241
Rome will burn.

1019
00:42:36,103 --> 00:42:37,620
-We're here. Whoo!
-We're here. We're here.

1020
00:42:37,724 --> 00:42:39,517
-Finally.
-A lot to talk about,

1021
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:40,931
- I think.
- Ah.

1022
00:42:41,034 --> 00:42:42,896
I think we have
a big gossip session

1023
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,379
- ahead of us.
- Yes.

1024
00:42:44,482 --> 00:42:47,758
<i>I did not want
to go on this journey.</i>

1025
00:42:47,862 --> 00:42:50,344
I personally think that journeys
are a great opportunity

1026
00:42:50,448 --> 00:42:52,103
to switch up your luck
if you're on the bottom.

1027
00:42:52,206 --> 00:42:53,758
But if you're in
a pretty good position,

1028
00:42:53,862 --> 00:42:57,241
<i>like me, this just puts
a bigger target on your back.</i>

1029
00:42:59,310 --> 00:43:02,413
Well, can we take some time
to chat?

1030
00:43:02,517 --> 00:43:05,241
Yes, we can chat beforehand.

1031
00:43:05,344 --> 00:43:07,103
<i>But here's the thing
with</i> Survivor.

1032
00:43:07,206 --> 00:43:08,896
There's gonna be twists thrown
your way that you can't control.

1033
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,689
<i>And you know what? I'm going
to deal with those risks.</i>

1034
00:43:10,793 --> 00:43:12,448
<i>I'm gonna deal
with them head-on,</i>

1035
00:43:12,551 --> 00:43:14,655
and I'm going
to make them advantages.

1036
00:43:14,758 --> 00:43:18,275
- There was a bros alliance
our first few days.
-Oh.

1037
00:43:18,379 --> 00:43:20,068
Is it still kind of bro-y?

1038
00:43:20,172 --> 00:43:22,172
In general,
vibes have completely shifted

1039
00:43:22,275 --> 00:43:23,172
is what I would say.

1040
00:43:23,275 --> 00:43:24,655
- I'm glad. I'm glad.
- Yes.

1041
00:43:24,758 --> 00:43:26,482
I'm in a position
of low information, I think.

1042
00:43:26,586 --> 00:43:28,482
So I feel like, you know,

1043
00:43:28,586 --> 00:43:30,413
- on the bottom.
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1044
00:43:30,517 --> 00:43:32,413
And if you want to know
where the crack is at Gata,

1045
00:43:32,517 --> 00:43:33,931
like, come find me at the merge.

1046
00:43:34,034 --> 00:43:35,275
<i>I'm trying to massage my image.</i>

1047
00:43:35,379 --> 00:43:37,206
<i>I'm trying to do some PR, like,</i>

1048
00:43:37,310 --> 00:43:39,827
that if I am someone
who feels like a social outcast

1049
00:43:39,931 --> 00:43:42,103
<i>on my tribe, that is</i>

1050
00:43:42,206 --> 00:43:44,344
<i>the picture-perfect archetype
of someone</i>

1051
00:43:44,448 --> 00:43:47,620
that players want to scoop up
at the merge, not target.

1052
00:43:47,724 --> 00:43:49,896
Sol and Rome have sort of,
like, this machismo-off,

1053
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,241
- where, like, they're... Yeah.
- Interesting.

1054
00:43:52,344 --> 00:43:54,206
Like, they are
kind of like an ego battle.

1055
00:43:54,310 --> 00:43:57,586
So I feel like
it would be one of them tonight.

1056
00:43:57,689 --> 00:43:59,137
- Those are my guesses...
-Okay. Okay.

1057
00:43:59,241 --> 00:44:01,241
- ...based on last time.
-Again,

1058
00:44:01,344 --> 00:44:02,931
I get really good vibes
genuinely from the both of you.

1059
00:44:03,034 --> 00:44:04,586
- Seriously. No, this is real.
- I know.

1060
00:44:04,689 --> 00:44:06,551
- This is better than I, like,
felt so far. Yeah.
- Yeah.

1061
00:44:06,655 --> 00:44:08,758
No matter what,
good luck, you all.

1062
00:44:08,862 --> 00:44:10,172
- No hard feelings whatsoever.
- Okay.

1063
00:44:42,310 --> 00:44:44,482
Okay.

1064
00:44:44,586 --> 00:44:45,965
I feel like I'm next.

1065
00:44:46,068 --> 00:44:48,000
- Yeah.
- Would you volunteer?

1066
00:44:48,103 --> 00:44:50,517
Ours is looking
really, really shaky, genuinely,

1067
00:44:50,620 --> 00:44:52,137
about
where the pieces are going.

1068
00:44:52,241 --> 00:44:54,379
I mean, obviously,
I'm going tonight, right?

1069
00:44:54,482 --> 00:44:55,758
Yes. Yes.

1070
00:44:55,862 --> 00:44:58,103
Is-is there a consensus,
though-- Rome versus Sol?

1071
00:44:58,206 --> 00:45:01,241
No, but I feel like
I do kind of trust the people

1072
00:45:01,344 --> 00:45:03,241
I'm working with,
but, like, you guys do

1073
00:45:03,344 --> 00:45:04,758
have to understand,
like, I'm going,

1074
00:45:04,862 --> 00:45:06,068
- and neither of you are going.
- Understood.

1075
00:45:06,172 --> 00:45:07,413
<i>
Neither of them are budging.</i>

1076
00:45:07,517 --> 00:45:09,206
<i>My next Tribal Council is-is...</i>

1077
00:45:09,310 --> 00:45:11,551
is now. You know,
I don't have much time to waste.

1078
00:45:11,655 --> 00:45:13,655
Like, you guys
at least have some time.

1079
00:45:13,758 --> 00:45:15,103
I don't want to lose my vote.

1080
00:45:15,206 --> 00:45:16,689
- I think... I'm sorry.
- I think I have to think
about it.

1081
00:45:16,793 --> 00:45:18,172
- We don't have much time.
- Let me just...

1082
00:45:18,275 --> 00:45:19,586
Can I just think real quick
about, like,

1083
00:45:19,689 --> 00:45:20,758
- the numbers real quick?
- Please.
- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1084
00:45:20,862 --> 00:45:22,793
<i>
I'm getting so nervous.</i>

1085
00:45:22,896 --> 00:45:24,551
If no one volunteers
to give up their vote,

1086
00:45:24,655 --> 00:45:27,275
<i>all three of us lose our vote
at the next Tribal.</i>

1087
00:45:27,379 --> 00:45:31,034
<i>It's the very,
very worst-case scenario.</i>

1088
00:45:37,896 --> 00:45:39,931
Okay, you know what?
I'll do it.

1089
00:45:40,034 --> 00:45:41,827
- I love you. Okay. Perfect.
- Thank you.
- I'll do it.

1090
00:45:41,931 --> 00:45:44,068
<i>I don't want
to look back on this</i>

1091
00:45:44,172 --> 00:45:45,655
<i>and feel like an idiot, but</i>

1092
00:45:45,758 --> 00:45:47,413
whether it's Rome or it's Sol

1093
00:45:47,517 --> 00:45:50,379
<i>going home tonight, I think
it could work without my vote.</i>

1094
00:45:50,482 --> 00:45:52,103
All right, guys.

1095
00:45:53,517 --> 00:45:55,172
Oh.

1096
00:45:55,275 --> 00:45:57,034
<i>
And in that moment, I felt</i>

1097
00:45:57,137 --> 00:45:59,206
I'm losing my vote either way.

1098
00:45:59,310 --> 00:46:01,965
I either get something
out of it, or I don't.

1099
00:46:31,862 --> 00:46:33,310
- Okay, I get it.
-And so
it's an idol no matter what.

1100
00:46:33,413 --> 00:46:35,586
It's an idol...
that we agree on.

1101
00:46:35,689 --> 00:46:36,724
Yes. That's better.

1102
00:46:36,827 --> 00:46:38,448
Okay, but, like, we can't use it

1103
00:46:38,551 --> 00:46:40,413
to be funky with each other.

1104
00:46:40,517 --> 00:46:42,448
It's different rules.
All we have to do. Like,

1105
00:46:42,551 --> 00:46:44,965
when we use it,
it will be all in agreement,

1106
00:46:45,068 --> 00:46:46,862
- and we'll be ready to go.
- To use as an idol.

1107
00:46:46,965 --> 00:46:49,068
<i>
Now, this is a new amulet.
This is not like amulets</i>

1108
00:46:49,172 --> 00:46:51,034
we've seen in the past. The
rules are slightly different.

1109
00:46:51,137 --> 00:46:54,103
<i>We can use this
to be a hidden immunity idol.</i>

1110
00:46:54,206 --> 00:46:56,448
<i>But in many ways
the inherent dilemma remains.</i>

1111
00:46:56,551 --> 00:46:58,793
<i>Is this an opportunity for peace</i>

1112
00:46:58,896 --> 00:47:00,206
and collaboration,

1113
00:47:00,310 --> 00:47:03,000
or is it an opportunity
for warfare?

1114
00:47:13,275 --> 00:47:17,620
Andy!

1115
00:47:17,724 --> 00:47:20,344
- Story time.
- Story time.

1116
00:47:20,448 --> 00:47:21,758
Whoo!

1117
00:47:21,862 --> 00:47:23,344
Welcome home!

1118
00:47:23,448 --> 00:47:25,068
Oh, I can't wait.

1119
00:47:25,172 --> 00:47:26,965
Feels so good to be home.

1120
00:47:27,068 --> 00:47:28,448
Hello.

1121
00:47:28,551 --> 00:47:31,172
No one came to greet me?

1122
00:47:31,275 --> 00:47:33,275
All right, well, let me
just start off. I lost my vote.

1123
00:47:33,379 --> 00:47:36,482
That's horrible.
I've mourned, I've cried.

1124
00:47:36,586 --> 00:47:39,586
It's a new amulet
split between the three of us.

1125
00:47:39,689 --> 00:47:41,965
- Here he is.
- Oh.

1126
00:47:42,068 --> 00:47:45,137
Oh, my God. That is amazing.

1127
00:47:45,241 --> 00:47:47,758
I actually think this is
a huge key for us to...

1128
00:47:47,862 --> 00:47:51,000
-Agreed.
- We form a dominant alliance
at the merge.

1129
00:47:51,103 --> 00:47:53,827
Long story short,
I ended up with a friend for us.

1130
00:47:55,551 --> 00:47:58,034
Okay, here's how it works.
Different type of amulet.

1131
00:47:58,137 --> 00:48:01,862
If the three holders can agree
to play it, and it's an idol.

1132
00:48:01,965 --> 00:48:03,034
Uh-oh.

1133
00:48:06,586 --> 00:48:08,344
Yeah.

1134
00:48:08,448 --> 00:48:10,103
So I was like,
"I'll just lose it tonight.

1135
00:48:10,206 --> 00:48:11,655
"'Cause I'm gonna lose it
either way.

1136
00:48:11,758 --> 00:48:13,448
- Might as well get something
out of it."
- Mm-hmm.

1137
00:48:13,551 --> 00:48:15,448
We all got amulets.

1138
00:48:15,551 --> 00:48:17,000
- Ooh.
-They can only be used

1139
00:48:17,103 --> 00:48:18,586
- when all players are
on the same beach.
- Oh, okay.

1140
00:48:20,413 --> 00:48:21,965
- No.
- Okay.

1141
00:48:22,068 --> 00:48:24,551
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

1142
00:48:24,655 --> 00:48:27,724
Me and Genevieve
are voting Rome.

1143
00:48:29,103 --> 00:48:31,448
Yeah.

1144
00:48:31,551 --> 00:48:33,724
<i>
I definitely feel powerless
without a vote.</i>

1145
00:48:33,827 --> 00:48:36,551
<i>But I feel really lucky
to have found alliance partners</i>

1146
00:48:36,655 --> 00:48:39,724
who are coming up with plans
without me even being there,

1147
00:48:39,827 --> 00:48:42,034
<i>especially with my number one Kishan.</i>

1148
00:48:42,137 --> 00:48:43,413
I'm proud of you guys
for coming up with this...

1149
00:48:43,517 --> 00:48:45,448
That was all Kish.
I just, like,

1150
00:48:45,551 --> 00:48:47,827
sat here and got told the plan.
It was amazing.

1151
00:48:47,931 --> 00:48:50,724
- Just, are you telling Sol?
- We told Sol.

1152
00:48:50,827 --> 00:48:52,241
- You did?
- He is totally game.

1153
00:48:52,344 --> 00:48:53,689
- So I can tell Sol, too?
- Yes.

1154
00:48:53,793 --> 00:48:55,379
- Like, you're in.
- Yeah.

1155
00:48:55,482 --> 00:48:57,068
- You're fully in.
- Yeah.

1156
00:48:57,172 --> 00:48:59,275
- And I'm so happy.
- Me, too.

1157
00:48:59,379 --> 00:49:01,482
<i>
Sol is somebody
who I want to keep.</i>

1158
00:49:01,586 --> 00:49:03,482
<i>And if that means
that we get out Rome,</i>

1159
00:49:03,586 --> 00:49:05,931
<i>who is a bit of a nuisance
around camp,</i>

1160
00:49:06,034 --> 00:49:07,689
<i>who stresses us out
in the game a little bit,</i>

1161
00:49:07,793 --> 00:49:09,965
then great.
It's a win-win.

1162
00:49:10,068 --> 00:49:12,379
The plan was,
that me and Kishan came up with,

1163
00:49:12,482 --> 00:49:14,965
was to tell Sol
that we're voting for Genevieve.

1164
00:49:15,068 --> 00:49:17,482
Interesting.
And whose suggestion was

1165
00:49:17,586 --> 00:49:19,413
- to throw Genevieve's name out?
- Uh, Kishan.

1166
00:49:20,448 --> 00:49:22,862
But I get why you wouldn't...
wouldn't like that, obviously.

1167
00:49:22,965 --> 00:49:24,689
- Yes. Yeah.
- Nobody likes
their name being...

1168
00:49:24,793 --> 00:49:28,172
being the, you know, the decoy,
but obviously we, like...

1169
00:49:28,275 --> 00:49:29,551
- 100%. 100%.
- Yeah, we're good to go.

1170
00:49:29,655 --> 00:49:30,931
So it wasn't, like,
a malice thing

1171
00:49:31,034 --> 00:49:32,655
- that Kishan threw your name
out there.
- No.

1172
00:49:32,758 --> 00:49:34,103
- Of course not.
- Like, I promise.

1173
00:49:36,724 --> 00:49:38,793
Does Genevieve sound believable?

1174
00:49:38,896 --> 00:49:41,172
I'm not here to play safe.
I'm here to create some chaos.

1175
00:49:41,275 --> 00:49:42,482
<i>What about Genevieve?</i>

1176
00:49:42,586 --> 00:49:44,068
<i>You know,
strength is a big issue.</i>

1177
00:49:44,172 --> 00:49:45,379
<i>So what if we say Genevieve?</i>

1178
00:49:45,482 --> 00:49:46,896
<i>Once Rome's gone,</i>

1179
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,034
<i>that leaves Genevieve
in a really vulnerable position.</i>

1180
00:49:49,137 --> 00:49:52,068
<i>
Rome going home
is Kishan's plan.</i>

1181
00:49:52,172 --> 00:49:55,758
<i>And I am a bossy, type A woman,</i>

1182
00:49:55,862 --> 00:49:58,896
<i>and I don't want to just
be going along with plans,</i>

1183
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,379
especially if they're not
in my best interests.

1184
00:50:01,482 --> 00:50:04,137
Like, Rome is an asset
for me in this game.

1185
00:50:04,241 --> 00:50:06,689
And he's ruffling
people's feathers, but not mine.

1186
00:50:06,793 --> 00:50:09,103
<i>He trusts me.
He will have my back.</i>

1187
00:50:09,206 --> 00:50:10,517
<i>I mean, as much
as anyone out here will.</i>

1188
00:50:10,620 --> 00:50:13,551
<i>And the biggest red flag
for me is,</i>

1189
00:50:13,655 --> 00:50:17,379
<i>Kishan doesn't hesitate to use
my name as the decoy vote,</i>

1190
00:50:17,482 --> 00:50:18,931
<i>which lets me know</i>

1191
00:50:19,034 --> 00:50:21,482
<i>he's not really intimidated
or respecting my game.</i>

1192
00:50:21,586 --> 00:50:22,965
<i>So maybe it's time</i>

1193
00:50:23,068 --> 00:50:25,655
to stop going along
with Kishan's plan

1194
00:50:25,758 --> 00:50:28,517
and make Kishan the plan.

1195
00:50:28,620 --> 00:50:30,000
- What's up?
- I need to give you a heads-up,

1196
00:50:30,103 --> 00:50:32,517
- and I need to make it quick.
- Okay.

1197
00:50:32,620 --> 00:50:34,586
You're the plan tonight.

1198
00:50:34,689 --> 00:50:36,482
I'm 100% serious.

1199
00:50:38,206 --> 00:50:40,793
- So, does Teeny
know about this?
- Everyone knows about it.

1200
00:50:42,551 --> 00:50:44,000
All these brilliant plans
are his.

1201
00:50:44,103 --> 00:50:45,724
What do you want to do?

1202
00:50:45,827 --> 00:50:47,103
<i>
That's just so wild</i>

1203
00:50:47,206 --> 00:50:48,448
<i>that Kishan would
throw that out there.</i>

1204
00:50:48,551 --> 00:50:49,758
<i>Why would they want me out</i>

1205
00:50:49,862 --> 00:50:51,724
if they know I'm going hard
for the alliance?

1206
00:50:51,827 --> 00:50:53,241
That's just so...

1207
00:50:53,344 --> 00:50:55,655
<i>The second
that I heard Kishan might want</i>

1208
00:50:55,758 --> 00:50:58,689
<i>to put my name out there,
I was a little bit hurt because</i>

1209
00:50:58,793 --> 00:51:00,206
I wanted to do everything
that I could

1210
00:51:00,310 --> 00:51:02,068
to make the alliance
as strong as possible.

1211
00:51:02,172 --> 00:51:03,586
And now, at this point,

1212
00:51:03,689 --> 00:51:04,896
<i>I don't feel like I can trust</i>

1213
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,862
<i>anyone in this game
but Genevieve.</i>

1214
00:51:06,965 --> 00:51:08,172
Does Sol know about it?

1215
00:51:10,068 --> 00:51:11,206
<i>
My Steal a Vote
could be massive tonight.</i>

1216
00:51:11,310 --> 00:51:13,379
<i>Maybe we could
just get out Kishan.</i>

1217
00:51:13,482 --> 00:51:16,310
<i>Or I could block him completely
from being able to vote</i>

1218
00:51:16,413 --> 00:51:18,275
<i>and put two votes on Sol.</i>

1219
00:51:18,379 --> 00:51:20,551
<i>And just like that,
Sol will be going home.</i>

1220
00:51:20,655 --> 00:51:22,379
<i>I'm willing to do it
because guess what.</i>

1221
00:51:22,482 --> 00:51:24,586
<i>I already know
the guy doesn't like me.</i>

1222
00:51:24,689 --> 00:51:27,379
This, uh, uh, crazy, toxic,

1223
00:51:27,482 --> 00:51:30,517
<i>brother-like relationship
is a huge problem long-term.</i>

1224
00:51:32,758 --> 00:51:34,758
- He put Rome up to it.
- Uh-huh.

1225
00:51:34,862 --> 00:51:37,448
And everyone is benefiting
from you two fighting.

1226
00:51:39,793 --> 00:51:41,137
Uh-huh.

1227
00:51:46,896 --> 00:51:49,034
There's no way
I'm not voting Rome tonight.

1228
00:51:49,137 --> 00:51:51,379
Let's just stick... Can we
please just stick to the plan?

1229
00:51:51,482 --> 00:51:54,310
<i>
There is no way I can pull off
a Kishan blindside</i>

1230
00:51:54,413 --> 00:51:57,517
<i>without Rome and Sol,
but they're openly adversaries.</i>

1231
00:51:57,620 --> 00:51:58,793
<i>And then
Teeny doesn't have a vote,</i>

1232
00:51:58,896 --> 00:52:00,931
<i>and she's really close
with Kishan.</i>

1233
00:52:01,034 --> 00:52:02,862
<i>So that's really not an option
to me.</i>

1234
00:52:05,068 --> 00:52:06,103
- I know.
- Like, why?

1235
00:52:06,206 --> 00:52:08,068
- 'Cause Genevieve loves us.
- Yeah.

1236
00:52:08,172 --> 00:52:10,862
<i>
But Rome and Sol have now
just had this big fight,</i>

1237
00:52:10,965 --> 00:52:12,034
almost to the point
that it's irreparable damage

1238
00:52:12,137 --> 00:52:13,241
that can't be undone.

1239
00:52:13,344 --> 00:52:15,931
<i>So it is going to take a miracle</i>

1240
00:52:16,034 --> 00:52:17,724
<i>to get them to work together.</i>

1241
00:52:17,827 --> 00:52:20,620
There's just no, no, no way.

1242
00:52:20,724 --> 00:52:22,068
Sol, I just want to say

1243
00:52:22,172 --> 00:52:25,896
that, like, I know that I
probably came across way wrong,

1244
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,137
and, like, I just want you
to know that I'm...

1245
00:52:28,241 --> 00:52:30,482
I apologize
if I came off threatening

1246
00:52:30,586 --> 00:52:32,482
or whatever, you know,
you may think.

1247
00:52:32,586 --> 00:52:33,655
All right, I appreciate that.

1248
00:52:33,758 --> 00:52:35,965
- Okay. Okay.
- Yeah. Yeah.

1249
00:52:36,068 --> 00:52:38,448
Yeah. It's a game.

1250
00:52:38,551 --> 00:52:40,862
- We need to get control.
- Right, but...

1251
00:52:40,965 --> 00:52:42,793
- We're not gonna have it.
- ...after, after...

1252
00:52:42,896 --> 00:52:44,689
- We're not gonna have it.
- Yes, we will. I...

1253
00:52:44,793 --> 00:52:46,137
We're not gonna have it.

1254
00:52:46,241 --> 00:52:47,655
Could be
a million-dollar decision.

1255
00:52:47,758 --> 00:52:50,137
<i>Sol's like, "I don't want
to work with Rome."</i>

1256
00:52:50,241 --> 00:52:52,137
<i>Rome's like, "It's a done deal.</i>

1257
00:52:52,241 --> 00:52:53,689
<i>Sol is going home tonight."</i>

1258
00:52:53,793 --> 00:52:56,551
<i>And what would be best
for my game would be to take</i>

1259
00:52:56,655 --> 00:52:59,448
a stealth shot at Kishan
that he wouldn't see coming.

1260
00:52:59,551 --> 00:53:01,448
Is it bad that I'm excited?

1261
00:53:01,551 --> 00:53:02,965
It's gonna be a wild night.

1262
00:53:03,068 --> 00:53:04,586
<i>The problem is, you have</i>

1263
00:53:04,689 --> 00:53:06,344
<i>to be in the majority,
you need numbers.</i>

1264
00:53:06,448 --> 00:53:08,620
It is not a one-person game.
Genevieve doesn't get to pick.

1265
00:53:08,724 --> 00:53:11,034
<i>But with so few votes,</i>

1266
00:53:11,137 --> 00:53:13,551
<i>and because the Steal a Vote
advantage exists,</i>

1267
00:53:13,655 --> 00:53:15,586
<i>anything could happen,</i>

1268
00:53:15,689 --> 00:53:17,034
<i>and it wouldn't take too much</i>

1269
00:53:17,137 --> 00:53:19,724
to turn the tide.

1270
00:53:53,724 --> 00:53:55,275
All right.

1271
00:53:55,379 --> 00:53:57,827
So let's start by talking
about today's challenge.

1272
00:53:57,931 --> 00:54:02,103
Rome, I've never really seen
anything like today in the sense

1273
00:54:02,206 --> 00:54:04,862
that you got to the puzzle
first and never got

1274
00:54:04,965 --> 00:54:08,000
a single piece,
not one piece of the puzzle.

1275
00:54:08,103 --> 00:54:09,482
You know, we did great

1276
00:54:09,586 --> 00:54:11,379
in the first part
of the challenge today.

1277
00:54:11,482 --> 00:54:14,586
We were the first ones to get
to the puzzle, so I stepped up.

1278
00:54:14,689 --> 00:54:17,000
I wanted to, you know,
try my hand at it.

1279
00:54:17,103 --> 00:54:19,275
And, unfortunately,
I failed pretty miserably.

1280
00:54:19,379 --> 00:54:21,310
I was surprised

1281
00:54:21,413 --> 00:54:23,344
that you never wanted
a different perspective,

1282
00:54:23,448 --> 00:54:25,448
like to step back
or to look at it this way.

1283
00:54:25,551 --> 00:54:27,655
You just kept,
like a doctor taking the...

1284
00:54:27,758 --> 00:54:29,758
Maybe Kishan can give
a better analogy, but...

1285
00:54:29,862 --> 00:54:30,931
- Scalpel.

1286
00:54:31,034 --> 00:54:32,931
Like the scalpel, yeah.

1287
00:54:33,034 --> 00:54:34,379
Well, I don't even know

1288
00:54:34,482 --> 00:54:36,379
if doing it differently
would have changed anything,

1289
00:54:36,482 --> 00:54:38,620
in all honesty.
I truly feel like we're just

1290
00:54:38,724 --> 00:54:41,724
not that great at those specific
type of puzzles.

1291
00:54:41,827 --> 00:54:44,965
Okay, so you lost,
you're back here at Tribal.

1292
00:54:45,068 --> 00:54:49,310
So, Sol, if I dropped in
on Camp Lavo this afternoon,

1293
00:54:49,413 --> 00:54:51,068
what would I notice happening?

1294
00:54:51,172 --> 00:54:53,172
Chaos times ten is what
you would have walked into.

1295
00:54:53,275 --> 00:54:55,206
- Wow.
- Yeah.

1296
00:54:55,310 --> 00:54:58,034
Look, after the challenge,
Rome announces to me

1297
00:54:58,137 --> 00:54:59,655
that he has a Steal a Vote,

1298
00:54:59,758 --> 00:55:01,551
which shocked the hell
out of me.

1299
00:55:01,655 --> 00:55:03,931
And he basically said,

1300
00:55:04,034 --> 00:55:06,689
"Since you're on the bottom,
you and I can work together.

1301
00:55:06,793 --> 00:55:08,551
"Uh, the only way
I'll do that, though,

1302
00:55:08,655 --> 00:55:11,206
is if you give me
your Shot in the Dark."

1303
00:55:11,310 --> 00:55:12,379
Listen, it's not like

1304
00:55:12,482 --> 00:55:13,620
he didn't write my name down

1305
00:55:13,724 --> 00:55:15,034
last Tribal Council. He did.

1306
00:55:15,137 --> 00:55:16,931
So I told him, "The only way
that I would trust you

1307
00:55:17,034 --> 00:55:18,896
"to work with you is if you
give me your Shot in the Dark.

1308
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,758
"But if you don't,

1309
00:55:20,862 --> 00:55:23,137
"then I'm gonna use
my Steal a Vote on you,

1310
00:55:23,241 --> 00:55:25,344
"and you're not gonna be able
to play your Shot in the Dark,

1311
00:55:25,448 --> 00:55:27,551
and you're gonna
be going home tonight."

1312
00:55:27,655 --> 00:55:30,413
Sol, given the fact
that you did vote for Rome,

1313
00:55:30,517 --> 00:55:33,034
that's not
that unusual a request.

1314
00:55:33,137 --> 00:55:34,724
It's kind of smart,

1315
00:55:34,827 --> 00:55:37,137
but at the same time, for me,
the way he went about it,

1316
00:55:37,241 --> 00:55:39,965
that's the key.
I didn't appreciate it, and so

1317
00:55:40,068 --> 00:55:41,620
I said,
"Are you threatening me, dude?"

1318
00:55:41,724 --> 00:55:43,344
- Uh, what did you say?
- I said, "No.

1319
00:55:43,448 --> 00:55:45,620
- it's an ultimatum,
not a threat."
- Right.

1320
00:55:45,724 --> 00:55:47,862
And so, for me, it sounds
like a threat, so I said,

1321
00:55:47,965 --> 00:55:49,517
"No, I'm not doing it."

1322
00:55:49,620 --> 00:55:51,482
And, Rome, your threat about

1323
00:55:51,586 --> 00:55:54,206
- stealing his vote is...
- Ultimatum, Jeff.

1324
00:55:54,310 --> 00:55:55,827
- The ultimatum

1325
00:55:55,931 --> 00:55:59,137
about stealing his vote is
that you have

1326
00:55:59,241 --> 00:56:01,655
to have a vote in order
to play the Shot in the Dark.

1327
00:56:01,758 --> 00:56:03,724
Precisely. And I just want

1328
00:56:03,827 --> 00:56:05,689
to say, Jeff, I, in the moment,

1329
00:56:05,793 --> 00:56:07,724
thought that that was
the right thing to do,

1330
00:56:07,827 --> 00:56:10,620
but the way that I did it and
the way that I approached Sol

1331
00:56:10,724 --> 00:56:11,931
was just not respectful.

1332
00:56:12,034 --> 00:56:14,517
Everyone that knows me
in real life knows

1333
00:56:14,620 --> 00:56:16,379
I'm a super genuine person.

1334
00:56:16,482 --> 00:56:18,655
So I went to him today,
and I apologized,

1335
00:56:18,758 --> 00:56:20,034
and I think
that he does understand

1336
00:56:20,137 --> 00:56:22,310
that that's...
that's just not who I am.

1337
00:56:22,413 --> 00:56:24,310
Kishan,
what's your take on this?

1338
00:56:24,413 --> 00:56:26,206
Because
when there's only five of you,

1339
00:56:26,310 --> 00:56:28,793
it doesn't take much
to vote somebody out.

1340
00:56:28,896 --> 00:56:30,758
An argument can do it.

1341
00:56:30,862 --> 00:56:33,620
You know, we're spending
24 hours a day with each other.

1342
00:56:33,724 --> 00:56:35,827
I think
when you're so deprived of food,

1343
00:56:35,931 --> 00:56:38,172
you can't sleep at night,

1344
00:56:38,275 --> 00:56:39,689
there are parts
of people's personalities

1345
00:56:39,793 --> 00:56:42,172
that are gonna come out
that bother you, that irk you.

1346
00:56:42,275 --> 00:56:46,310
But I think if you let
an argument guide your vote,

1347
00:56:46,413 --> 00:56:48,517
that's letting emotions get
to you.

1348
00:56:48,620 --> 00:56:50,344
I think
when you're playing this game,

1349
00:56:50,448 --> 00:56:52,310
you have to be more strategic
than that.

1350
00:56:52,413 --> 00:56:54,862
-Teeny,
how about for you?
- From my vantage point

1351
00:56:54,965 --> 00:56:56,551
as somebody who wasn't involved
in the fight

1352
00:56:56,655 --> 00:56:58,655
and also from my vantage point
as someone

1353
00:56:58,758 --> 00:57:01,275
who did lose their vote
on a journey today,

1354
00:57:01,379 --> 00:57:03,620
all I could really do
is put trust

1355
00:57:03,724 --> 00:57:06,758
in the people that I had
worked with last Tribal Council

1356
00:57:06,862 --> 00:57:08,758
and hope that it goes well.

1357
00:57:08,862 --> 00:57:10,724
Genevieve,
what do you make about this?

1358
00:57:10,827 --> 00:57:12,137
Because it sounds like

1359
00:57:12,241 --> 00:57:14,275
there could be two people
that aren't voting.

1360
00:57:14,379 --> 00:57:16,344
Teeny lost her vote,

1361
00:57:16,448 --> 00:57:18,482
Rome is threatening
to steal somebody else's vote.

1362
00:57:18,586 --> 00:57:21,068
That means
it could be four total votes,

1363
00:57:21,172 --> 00:57:23,000
but just three people.

1364
00:57:23,103 --> 00:57:25,758
Yeah. It means...

1365
00:57:25,862 --> 00:57:28,551
those three people
have a lot of power.

1366
00:57:28,655 --> 00:57:33,000
And you better hope those three
people are working with you

1367
00:57:33,103 --> 00:57:35,206
and have your back, because

1368
00:57:35,310 --> 00:57:37,620
they're gonna rule the day
today.

1369
00:57:37,724 --> 00:57:38,965
Jeff, I don't think

1370
00:57:39,068 --> 00:57:41,068
at the end of the day
it changes much

1371
00:57:41,172 --> 00:57:42,724
because it comes down to trust.

1372
00:57:42,827 --> 00:57:45,000
You trust the conversations
you had.

1373
00:57:45,103 --> 00:57:47,137
You trust a plan
that you've set forward.

1374
00:57:47,241 --> 00:57:48,724
It doesn't matter
because you trust

1375
00:57:48,827 --> 00:57:50,793
- what the plan is in place.
-So, Sol,

1376
00:57:50,896 --> 00:57:53,620
that can't make you feel great.

1377
00:57:53,724 --> 00:57:55,620
Nope. Not great at all, and, um,

1378
00:57:55,724 --> 00:57:58,000
I'm just begging Rome,

1379
00:57:58,103 --> 00:58:00,758
bro, maybe not steal my vote?

1380
00:58:00,862 --> 00:58:02,482
I do have
my Shot in the Dark here.

1381
00:58:02,586 --> 00:58:06,241
If my vote is not gone,
I am playing it.

1382
00:58:06,344 --> 00:58:10,103
And, Rome, what's interesting
about this is,

1383
00:58:10,206 --> 00:58:11,517
that's a real person...

1384
00:58:11,620 --> 00:58:13,344
- Yeah.
- I am a very real person...

1385
00:58:13,448 --> 00:58:15,068
-...saying to you...
- ...in the flesh behind you.

1386
00:58:15,172 --> 00:58:18,896
- Yeah.
- ...that, "I'm already
in trouble, I think.

1387
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,896
And now you're taking
the only protection I have,"

1388
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,448
which is the only move to make
if you want to take out Sol.

1389
00:58:23,551 --> 00:58:25,448
But Sol's pleading with you,

1390
00:58:25,551 --> 00:58:26,965
"Give me a shot."

1391
00:58:27,068 --> 00:58:28,551
At the end of the day,
it's going

1392
00:58:28,655 --> 00:58:30,000
to be my decision whether or not

1393
00:58:30,103 --> 00:58:32,551
I, uh, I take this guy's vote
or not, and,

1394
00:58:32,655 --> 00:58:34,620
you know, I just got to trust
the people that I trust,

1395
00:58:34,724 --> 00:58:36,655
and the people that I don't
trust, I'm not gonna trust you,

1396
00:58:36,758 --> 00:58:38,137
and I'm going
to do everything I can

1397
00:58:38,241 --> 00:58:40,310
to get you out of this game.

1398
00:58:40,413 --> 00:58:41,344
Wow.

1399
00:58:41,448 --> 00:58:43,344
Ooh.

1400
00:58:43,448 --> 00:58:46,241
- Spooky, scary, right?
- Yeah.

1401
00:58:46,344 --> 00:58:49,310
Is that the kind of laugh
you give when you're watching

1402
00:58:49,413 --> 00:58:51,034
<i>Survivor</i> at home, Genevieve?

1403
00:58:51,137 --> 00:58:52,517
When I'm watching Tribal,

1404
00:58:52,620 --> 00:58:54,275
and it gets like this,
and you're like,

1405
00:58:54,379 --> 00:58:58,482
"Oh, my God. Ooh,
something's happening." Like...

1406
00:58:58,586 --> 00:59:00,172
So from all this chaos,

1407
00:59:00,275 --> 00:59:03,724
where do you sit right now as
we are moments away from voting?

1408
00:59:03,827 --> 00:59:07,896
So, chaos times ten can be great
as long as you're not in it.

1409
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:11,413
But honestly,
if I'm wrong tonight,

1410
00:59:11,517 --> 00:59:12,586
it's over for me.

1411
00:59:12,689 --> 00:59:15,655
So I think that this vote is

1412
00:59:15,758 --> 00:59:20,655
critical to the future success
of my game.

1413
00:59:25,448 --> 00:59:28,448
All right, it is time to vote.

1414
00:59:32,689 --> 00:59:34,965
You know, Jeff, I, uh...

1415
00:59:35,068 --> 00:59:36,793
I trust the people
that I trust, like I said,

1416
00:59:36,896 --> 00:59:40,655
and I don't trust the people
that I don't trust.

1417
00:59:40,758 --> 00:59:42,689
So I got a Steal a Vote, and

1418
00:59:42,793 --> 00:59:44,896
I'm gonna be stealing
Kishan's vote tonight.

1419
00:59:54,793 --> 00:59:57,724
All right,
this is a Steal a Vote.

1420
00:59:57,827 --> 01:00:00,275
Rome, you are
taking Kishan's vote,

1421
01:00:00,379 --> 01:00:03,137
which means, Kishan,
you will not vote tonight.

1422
01:00:03,241 --> 01:00:06,551
Rome, when you go up,
you will vote twice.

1423
01:00:06,655 --> 01:00:10,827
All right, it is time to vote.
Genevieve, you're up.

1424
01:00:38,172 --> 01:00:42,000
I'm absolutely freaking out.

1425
01:01:11,206 --> 01:01:13,137
I'll go tally the votes.

1426
01:01:30,034 --> 01:01:31,862
If anybody has an advantage
or an idol,

1427
01:01:31,965 --> 01:01:35,137
and you want to play it,
now would be the time to do so.

1428
01:01:44,586 --> 01:01:47,241
All right, I'll read the votes.

1429
01:01:52,551 --> 01:01:54,172
First vote-- Kishan.

1430
01:02:04,965 --> 01:02:08,793
Kishan.
That's two votes-- Kishan.

1431
01:02:16,551 --> 01:02:19,862
Fourth person voted out
of <i>Survivor</i> 47-- Kishan.

1432
01:02:19,965 --> 01:02:21,965
That's three. That's enough.
Need to bring me your torch.

1433
01:02:37,413 --> 01:02:38,896
I love you, Kishan.

1434
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:40,517
I love you.

1435
01:02:42,620 --> 01:02:44,344
You guys are amazing.
Good game.

1436
01:02:44,448 --> 01:02:45,862
Good game.

1437
01:02:51,862 --> 01:02:53,689
Kishan, the tribe has spoken.

1438
01:02:57,241 --> 01:02:59,448
Time for you to go.

1439
01:02:59,551 --> 01:03:00,965
Good luck, y'alls.

1440
01:03:01,068 --> 01:03:01,965
- Thank you, man.
- Thanks, Kishan.
- Bye, Kishan.

1441
01:03:02,068 --> 01:03:03,827
Love you, brother.

1442
01:03:17,620 --> 01:03:19,310
Grab your torches.
Head back to camp.

1443
01:03:19,413 --> 01:03:21,413
Good night.

We've got a brand-new
<i>Survivor</i> twist.

1448
01:03:45,689 --> 01:03:47,620
<i>
Next time on</i> Survivor...

1449
01:03:48,827 --> 01:03:50,000
Right.

1450
01:03:50,103 --> 01:03:51,275
That creates some fireworks.

1451
01:03:51,379 --> 01:03:52,517
What?!

1452
01:03:53,689 --> 01:03:54,931
<i>
I'm angry.</i>

<i>I want to crush

1454
01:03:57,586 --> 01:03:58,965
and I want to smile
while it happens.

1455
01:04:03,551 --> 01:04:05,034
I got blindsided,
as simple as it can be.

1456

<i>Some people may have
caught wind of what I was doing,</i>

1457

01:04:08,931 --> 01:04:11,344
<i>So, props to them.

<i>Had I wished I won? Yes.</i>

1462
01:04:16,517 --> 01:04:18,517
<i>But I have no regrets.</i>

1463
01:04:18,620 --> 01:04:20,551
That's the beauty of the game.
You never know what to expect,

1464
01:04:20,655 --> 01:04:21,931
and that's what makes it fun.
